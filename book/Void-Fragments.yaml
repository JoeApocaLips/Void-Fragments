  \textit{Void-Fragments} is the fruit of a procedural monologue generator in Python inspired by Samuel Beckett’s \textit{Texts for Nothing}. It is not a program output in the technical sense, but a literary work born from algorithmic composition—an autonomous voice that speaks without body, circles around silence, and persists despite having nothing to say.
