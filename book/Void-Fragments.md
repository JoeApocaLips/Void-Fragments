Is existing enough?

No time, and yet it knows

a trace of voice, nothing more

no body, no name, and yet a voice

a voice

is it better?

\clearpage
knowing changes nothing, yet one knows

I look for a sound, but finds no sound

No chair, and yet I can

to be silent is what I’d like, but it speaks

She is not there, she is always there

One would like to know, but know is not possible

who speaks? me, perhaps, or someone else

Is it thus over?

to be is to err, yet one is

He does not know if he is silent, but he is silent

Neither room, nor sense, nor even the shadow of strength

I continue without past, without future, without present

\clearpage
gone, returned, never gone

I want to leave, but cannot

He cannot be, he goes be

It looks for a sense, but finds nothing

is there anything left to say?

One should know, but know changes nothing

I am there, more there, again there

Does one feel, or is it silence?

It goes end, but goes nowhere

It says, without movement, without language, without knowing why

is that enough?

\clearpage
No past, no sound, and yet know

She speaks without past, without future, without present

nothing, again

To stay, again stay, always stay, for nothing

I stay, again, always, never ending

Voice. movement. silence.

it’s the same thing, again the same, always the same

Must one mean, even without sense?

A light. no sound. a voice.

Neither thought, nor place, nor even the shadow of eye

what does it mean?

Is it always over?

I have no past, yet I repeat

is it always nothing?

What else to do but endure?

is it starting again?

\clearpage
He looks for a will, but finds no will

Do I repeat?

There is a voice that can, that’s all I know

Nothing to have, everything to have, same thing

No memory, and yet one waits

No mouth, no thought, and yet is

I am, without future, without strength, without knowing why

I am not here, I am again there

what am I saying?

To feel, again feel, always feel, for nothing

Does she repeat, or is it silence?

is it over?

\clearpage
More here, never there, always nowhere, and it understands

She is there, never there, long there

could it be nothing?

speak, speak again, always speak, to say nothing

One should begin, but begin has no meaning

It is silent to say nothing, that’s already something

Again there, but does it count?

it whispers, without ear, without echo, without end

I whisper, again, always, never ending, for nothing

he stays, without place, without name, without why

gone. returned.

\clearpage
nothing to say, nothing to do, nothing to be

Past, shadow, purpose: none of it

Where is the nothing that am silent? nowhere

is it enough, to speak in the dark?

He is, he does not know why

One wants to endure, but cannot

Elsewhere here, more there, here nowhere, and one repeats

He goes know, but goes nowhere

I am silent, yet it continues

Must one be?

what if that’s all?

a presence without body, that’s already too much

really the same?

\clearpage
It tries to stay, but stay is impossible

A name. no trace. a voice.

To be silent is to persist, but to persist is to speak

Place, eye, dust: none of it

One should can, but she cannot can

always the same?

I cannot know, I go know

who is speaking?

No time, and yet it whispers

He is no one, yet he has

One continues, again, always, never ending

\clearpage
I have no purpose, yet I speak

one cannot endure, one goes endure

Future, form, sense: none of it

It is not there, it is there there

without knowing, without power, without end

One has no name, yet one persists

Is it here over?

He speaks to say nothing, that’s already something

It cannot leave, it goes leave

I begin without past, without future, without present

is there anything left to say?

\clearpage
She has, without strength, without word, without knowing why

It feels, without strength, without sense, without language, without end

One would like to know, but know is not possible

She is silent, cannot stop

nothing more, nothing less, just that: a voice

Does he can?

Must one end, even without reason?

Voice. hand. silence.

shall we go on?

\clearpage
It does not know if it can, but it can

Neither form, nor silence, nor even the shadow of body

One should be, but I cannot be

She has no past, yet she speaks all the same

One should have, but have changes nothing

I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent

to persist is to fail, yet one persists

is that enough?

No mouth, no time, and yet continues

No foot, and yet I end

More here, long there, somewhere nowhere

\clearpage
It ends, it does not know why

I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on

A voice without hand, that’s all there is

A voice without past, that’s all there is

what does it mean?

I look for a soul, but find nothing

is that all?

there. again.

does it suffice?

One has no body, yet one repeats all the same

Does silence count as speaking?

She has no light, yet she continues

understanding undoes nothing, yet one understands

am I speaking again?

Neither eye, nor purpose, nor even the shadow of thought

who am I speaking to?

after that?

\clearpage
Vainly there. never gone. now returned.

There here, somewhere there, simply nowhere, and one continues

Where is the trace that stays? nowhere

Now there. more gone. long returned.

He is there, never there, already there

I am no one, yet I speak

no word, and yet it speaks ceaselessly

A voice without strength, that’s all there is

I am here, I am not, I am again

it never ends

\clearpage
Nothing to feel, everything to feel, same thing

One should have, but have changes nothing

a trace of voice, nothing more

One should know, but one cannot know

She has no silence, yet she erases all the same

He cannot speak, he goes speak

me, not me, me again

One can, without name, without space, without purpose, without end

one must mean, but meaning has fled

She says, again, always, never ending, for nothing

Do I endure, or is it silence?

a silence that speaks, that’s already something

what’s the point?

\clearpage
must one continue, even without reason?

a voice speaking into the void, that’s already something

Always there, but does it count?

One should go, but go has no meaning

Nothing to speak, everything to speak, same thing

I say nothing, I say it ceaselessly, I repeat it

No sound, and yet he is

One should have, but one cannot

is it sufficient?
