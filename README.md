# Void Fragments
**Smells Like Beckett Spirit.**

*A Beckettian Text Generator for NaNoGenMo 2025*

A procedural text generator **inspired** by Samuel Beckett’s *Texts for Nothing*.

This program produces a continuous, fragmented monologue that echoes Beckett’s late style:
- voice without a body
- speech that circles around silence
- repetition without progress
- questions without answers
- the obligation to speak despite having nothing to say

The output is a single text file (`Void-Fragments-(Date-Time).txt`), structured in **six generative modes**, each capturing a distinct tonality from *Texts for Nothing* (1–13):

- **Mode A**: Raw lexical shards — sparse, aphoristic fragments (Texts 1–5)
- **Mode B**: Interrogative vertigo — obsessive doubt, modal paralysis (Texts 6, 10–11)
- **Mode C**: Continuous murmuring — flowing recursive voice (Text 13)
- **Mode D**: Compulsive repetition — looping phrases, “again the same” (Texts 3, 5, 7)
- **Mode E**: Pure negation — impossibility, aporia, “cannot” (Texts 2, 4, 8)
- **Mode F**: Anatomy of absence — catalogues of deprivation (“no body, no name…”) (Texts 1, 6, 9)

All sentences are either drawn from a curated set of *original meta-phrases* or *generated through constrained templates* using weighted lexical choices (nouns, verbs, adverbs) consistent with *Beckett’s thematic universe*.

> **No text from Beckett’s published works is reproduced verbatim.**

## 📖 Output Sample

No thought, no light, and yet speak  
No will, and yet he knows  
No space, and yet it speaks  

is it too late?  
is this the beginning?  
Is being silent enough?  
who am I speaking to?  

I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on  
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same  
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent  

again this  
it’s the same thing, again the same, always the same  
speak, speak again, always speak, to say nothing  

Impossible to speak, yet one continues  
One should continue, but continue changes nothing  
I cannot stay, I go stay  

Without eye, without face, without name, and yet I stay  
Neither dust, nor space, nor even the shadow of chair  
No mouth, no breath, and yet is silent
