# Void Fragments
**Smells Like Beckett Spirit.**

*A Beckettian Text Generator for NaNoGenMo 2025*

A procedural text generator inspired by Samuel Beckett’s *Texts for Nothing*.

This program produces a continuous, fragmented monologue that echoes Beckett’s late style:
- voice without a body
- speech that circles around silence
- repetition without progress
- questions without answers
- the obligation to speak despite having nothing to say

The output is a single text file (`Void-Fragments-(Date-Time).txt`), structured in **six generative modes**, each capturing a distinct tonality from *Texts for Nothing* (1–13):

- **Mode A**: Raw lexical shards — sparse, aphoristic fragments (Texts 1–5)
- **Mode B**: Interrogative vertigo — obsessive doubt, modal paralysis (Texts 6, 10–11)
- **Mode C**: Continuous murmuring — flowing recursive voice (Text 13)
- **Mode D**: Compulsive repetition — looping phrases, “again the same” (Texts 3, 5, 7)
- **Mode E**: Pure negation — impossibility, aporia, “cannot” (Texts 2, 4, 8)
- **Mode F**: Anatomy of absence — catalogues of deprivation (“no body, no name…”) (Texts 1, 6, 9)

All sentences are either drawn from a curated set of *original meta-phrases* or *generated through constrained templates* using weighted lexical choices (nouns, verbs, adverbs) consistent with *Beckett’s thematic universe*.

> **No text from Beckett’s published works is reproduced verbatim.**

## 📖 Output Sample

no body, no name, and yet a voice  
me, not me, me again  
there is a voice, that’s all there is  
is it enough, to speak in the dark?  
I say nothing, yet I say it again  
I say nothing, yet I say it again  
I say nothing, yet I say it again  
without room, without thought, without mind, and yet one repeats  
Does she be?  
Must one endure, even without reason?  
Impossible to speak, yet he continues  
to speak of nothing, that’s all that remains  
who speaks? I speak, she speaks, it speaks  
before, after, now: the same thing  
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun  
a voice without body, that’s already too much  
I am no one, yet I speak  
without knowing, without power, without end  
gone. returned.  
there, again there, already gone  
I speak, therefore I am perhaps  
who speaks? me, perhaps, or someone else  
What if I stay for nothing?  
Is saying enough?  
Do I repeat?  
It does not stop  
One looks for a room, but finds nothing  
One goes without past, without future, without present  
Without foot, without trace, without strength, and yet it is  
A space. no word. a voice.  
He has no dust, yet he begins  
without body  
truly everything?  
He stays, without space, without light, without knowing why  
It is, again, always, never ending  
once more?  
I persist, I do not know why  
One cannot speak, one goes speak  
Does one continue?  
am I speaking for nothing?
