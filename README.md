# Void Fragments
**Smells Like Beckett Spirit.**

*A Beckettian Text Generator for NaNoGenMo 2025*

A procedural text generator **inspired** by Samuel Beckett’s *Texts for Nothing*.

This program produces a continuous, fragmented monologue that echoes Beckett’s late style:
- voice without a body
- speech that circles around silence
- repetition without progress
- questions without answers
- the obligation to speak despite having nothing to say

The output is a single text file (`Void-Fragments-(Date-Time).txt`), structured in **six generative modes**, each capturing a distinct tonality from *Texts for Nothing* (1–13):

- **Mode A**: Raw lexical shards — sparse, aphoristic fragments (Texts 1–5)
- **Mode B**: Interrogative vertigo — obsessive doubt, modal paralysis (Texts 6, 10–11)
- **Mode C**: Continuous murmuring — flowing recursive voice (Text 13)
- **Mode D**: Compulsive repetition — looping phrases, “again the same” (Texts 3, 5, 7)
- **Mode E**: Pure negation — impossibility, aporia, “cannot” (Texts 2, 4, 8)
- **Mode F**: Anatomy of absence — catalogues of deprivation (“no body, no name…”) (Texts 1, 6, 9)

All sentences are either drawn from a curated set of *original meta-phrases* or *generated through constrained templates* using weighted lexical choices (nouns, verbs, adverbs) consistent with *Beckett’s thematic universe*.

> **No text from Beckett’s published works is reproduced verbatim.**

## 📖 Output Sample

No thought, no light, and yet speak  
No will, and yet he knows  
No space, and yet it speaks  

is it too late?  
is this the beginning?  
Is being silent enough?  
who am I speaking to?  

I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on  
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same  
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent  

again this  
it’s the same thing, again the same, always the same  
speak, speak again, always speak, to say nothing  

Impossible to speak, yet one continues  
One should continue, but continue changes nothing  
I cannot stay, I go stay  

Without eye, without face, without name, and yet I stay  
Neither dust, nor space, nor even the shadow of chair  
No mouth, no breath, and yet is silent  

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python Void-Fragments.py
```
Then, copy Void-Fragments.md into the book/ directory and run makebook.bat from within that directory to generate the PDF using Pandoc.
(Make sure source.py — the ASCII-safe source code — is in the book/ directory.)


## Afterword

*Void Fragments* is the fruit of a Python-based procedural monologue generator inspired by Samuel Beckett’s *Texts for Nothing*. It is not a program output in the technical sense, but a literary work born from algorithmic composition—an autonomous voice that speaks without body, circles around silence, and persists despite having nothing to say.  
The text unfolds through six generative modes: aphoristic shards, obsessive questioning, compulsive repetition, pure negation, catalogues of absence, and murmuring continuities. These modes echo Beckett’s late prose not by imitation, but by resonance—reconstructing his existential cadence through original templates, curated fragments, and stochastic rhythm.  
No sentence is copied from Beckett’s published works. Every line is generated from scratch using a system of linguistic constraints, weighted lexicons, and poetic filters. The source code that produced this volume is included in the appendix not as documentation, but as a score: a set of instructions for a voice that cannot stop, even when it has nothing left to utter.
