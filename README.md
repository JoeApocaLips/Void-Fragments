# Void Fragments
**Smells Like Beckett Spirit.**

*A Beckettian Text Generator for NaNoGenMo 2025*

A procedural text generator inspired by Samuel Beckett’s *Texts for Nothing*.

This program produces a continuous, fragmented monologue that echoes Beckett’s late style:
- voice without a body
- speech that circles around silence
- repetition without progress
- questions without answers
- the obligation to speak despite having nothing to say

The output is a single text file (`Void-Fragments-(Date-Time).txt`), structured in **six generative modes**, each capturing a distinct tonality from *Texts for Nothing* (1–13):

- **Mode A**: Raw lexical shards — sparse, aphoristic fragments (Texts 1–5)
- **Mode B**: Interrogative vertigo — obsessive doubt, modal paralysis (Texts 6, 10–11)
- **Mode C**: Continuous murmuring — flowing recursive voice (Text 13)
- **Mode D**: Compulsive repetition — looping phrases, “again the same” (Texts 3, 5, 7)
- **Mode E**: Pure negation — impossibility, aporia, “cannot” (Texts 2, 4, 8)
- **Mode F**: Anatomy of absence — catalogues of deprivation (“no body, no name…”) (Texts 1, 6, 9)

All sentences are either drawn from a curated set of *original meta-phrases* or *generated through constrained templates* using weighted lexical choices (nouns, verbs, adverbs) consistent with *Beckett’s thematic universe*.

> **No text from Beckett’s published works is reproduced verbatim.**

## 📖 Output Sample

No body, no name, and yet a voice  
Without voice, without breath, without hand, and yet I can  
Silence, light, place: none of it  
Neither here, nor elsewhere, nowhere and there  

Impossible to speak, yet he continues  
One cannot speak, one goes speak  
Not to know, never to know, and yet know  
Without knowing, without power, without end  

I say nothing, yet I say it again  
I say nothing, yet I say it again  
I say nothing, yet I say it again  
To speak, again speak, always speak, for nothing  

Is it enough, to speak in the dark?  
Do I repeat?  
Must one endure, even without reason?  
Who speaks? me, perhaps, or someone else  

no me  
me, not me, me again  
a word  
gone. returned.  

There is a voice that is silent, that’s all she knows  
One is no one, yet one can  
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on  
to speak of nothing, that’s all that remains
