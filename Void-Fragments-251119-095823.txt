no me
Neither voice, nor will, nor even the shadow of presence
No time, and yet it exists
No hand, never foot, always without thought
no mouth, and yet it speaks
No future, and yet I am silent
Without presence, without silence, without soul, and yet it speaks
Without breath, without room, without word, and yet it speaks
what remains?

No time, and yet I stay
No reason, no face, and yet know
No echo, and yet I endure
Without will, without dust, without language, and yet it begins
No mouth, no eye, and yet repeats

No time, and yet he can
Without purpose, without movement, without language, and yet I end
No mouth, no space, and yet continues
Neither form, nor language, nor even the shadow of face
it ends, perhaps

No time, and yet I know
Silence, space, form: none of it
Space, soul, name: none of it
Without foot, without body, without soul, and yet it has
No dust, never sense, always without trace
Body, future, presence: none of it
is it too much?

No mouth, no form, and yet knows
No foot, and yet it speaks
without knowing, without power, without end
No time, and yet she waits
No time, and yet he stays
Neither memory, nor eye, nor even the shadow of trace
No shadow, and yet he says
No soul, never sense, always without nothing
that’s all there is

Without strength, without movement, without name, and yet he stays
No body, no face, and yet be
No mouth, no shadow, and yet erases
No mouth, no sound, and yet is
No form, and yet one begins
No mouth, no voice, and yet is
Without chair, without trace, without past, and yet she speaks
is it too little?

No reason, never thought, always without time
neither here, nor elsewhere, nowhere and there
No time, and yet she waits
no body, no name, and yet a voice
Sound, eye, past: none of it
is it always nothing?

No shadow, no language, and yet feel
No light, no sense, and yet understand
No time, and yet she says
Language, face, trace: none of it
No time, no future, and yet stay
No mouth, no soul, and yet knows
Reason, movement, presence: none of it
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
does it suffice?

No nothing, no purpose, and yet can
Room, place, light: none of it
No room, and yet he begins
No mouth, no purpose, and yet speaks
No place, and yet it stays
is it over?

No chair, no language, and yet be silent
No mind, no light, and yet be
Without purpose, without will, without future, and yet it is silent
Neither silence, nor soul, nor even the shadow of name
No space, never eye, always without purpose
Presence, past, space: none of it
Echo, face, thought: none of it
No eye, and yet I can
is it finished?

Neither sense, nor purpose, nor even the shadow of name
without body
No light, no room, and yet end
No presence, no past, and yet can
No time, and yet she has
No movement, no hand, and yet be
without body
Soul, voice, silence: none of it

No future, never breath, always without voice
Neither thought, nor light, nor even the shadow of place
what’s the point?
No mouth, no will, and yet can
Without movement, without reason, without dust, and yet he leaves
Strength, presence, body: none of it
No time, and yet he stays
nothing, or almost

No mouth, no language, and yet endures
No body, no eye, and yet continue
No time, and yet he repeats
Neither will, nor sound, nor even the shadow of presence
No time, and yet it is silent
once again.

Neither sense, nor room, nor even the shadow of word
No mouth, no will, and yet persists
Word, thought, hand: none of it
No time, and yet one is silent
No mouth, no shadow, and yet begins
Without trace, without past, without soul, and yet I exist
no me
no mouth, and yet it speaks
surely nothing

without knowing, without power, without end
No time, and yet one continues
Neither soul, nor body, nor even the shadow of trace
No time, and yet he goes
No time, and yet she whispers
No space, never reason, always without foot

no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
No future, never thought, always without nothing
Sound, shadow, eye: none of it
No will, no purpose, and yet speak
No chair, never trace, always without breath
No time, and yet one is
No breath, and yet he erases
nothing more.

No word, and yet it exists
No name, no trace, and yet can
No thought, never past, always without will
Without nothing, without future, without hand, and yet one waits

Voice, breath, past: none of it
Eye, space, movement: none of it
Neither will, nor echo, nor even the shadow of silence
No space, no trace, and yet endure

No mouth, no soul, and yet erases
neither here, nor elsewhere, nowhere and there
Neither trace, nor form, nor even the shadow of space
Dust, memory, trace: none of it
No time, and yet it waits
No nothing, never past, always without sound
am I speaking again?

No sense, never presence, always without echo
No mind, never nothing, always without place
No silence, no time, and yet be
No mouth, no body, and yet repeats

Without shadow, without place, without name, and yet he continues
No presence, and yet she endures
Neither form, nor nothing, nor even the shadow of future
No time, and yet he has
could it be nothing?
no body, no name, and yet a voice
No sound, and yet he endures
No mouth, no shadow, and yet begins
Neither presence, nor dust, nor even the shadow of breath
should we stop?

No shadow, and yet she says
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
neither here, nor elsewhere, nowhere and there
No hand, and yet it is silent
No mouth, no echo, and yet understands
Without foot, without silence, without voice, and yet I have
Mind, room, past: none of it
Neither soul, nor foot, nor even the shadow of room
is this the end?

No time, and yet I speak
No time, and yet she goes
No will, never past, always without sense
Chair, foot, room: none of it
Memory, language, movement: none of it
Without place, without time, without trace, and yet it whispers
No time, no presence, and yet endure
No sound, no soul, and yet be

No mouth, no voice, and yet whispers
Without voice, without body, without memory, and yet she speaks
No chair, never face, always without mind
No echo, never silence, always without name
No face, no strength, and yet whisper
Neither future, nor hand, nor even the shadow of room
Room, reason, form: none of it
No chair, no breath, and yet say

No time, and yet it is
Neither face, nor sound, nor even the shadow of will
No trace, and yet it continues
no me
No trace, no silence, and yet know
Neither body, nor time, nor even the shadow of mind
probably that’s it

without body
No dust, never body, always without thought
No sense, no trace, and yet speak
No mouth, no presence, and yet goes
No time, and yet one speaks
I go on, always

Neither movement, nor reason, nor even the shadow of name
Neither sound, nor chair, nor even the shadow of light
Neither mind, nor body, nor even the shadow of strength
Neither dust, nor name, nor even the shadow of eye

No mouth, no voice, and yet begins
Neither silence, nor hand, nor even the shadow of reason
without knowing, without power, without end
Without time, without chair, without form, and yet it repeats
No time, and yet I erase
No movement, and yet I am silent
Neither place, nor purpose, nor even the shadow of word

No time, and yet I persist
No memory, and yet I am
No light, and yet I know
Neither word, nor trace, nor even the shadow of past
Foot, silence, breath: none of it
Nothing, hand, strength: none of it
No time, and yet she persists
Without reason, without sense, without chair, and yet I speak
what if that’s all?

Without purpose, without shadow, without sense, and yet I know
No mouth, no trace, and yet speaks
No mouth, no form, and yet has
No silence, and yet one speaks
No time, never silence, always without face
is it surely nothing?

No time, and yet it repeats
No name, and yet I am
Neither time, nor space, nor even the shadow of movement
Neither strength, nor time, nor even the shadow of chair
No sense, never place, always without time
No mouth, no place, and yet knows

Form, eye, strength: none of it
No place, no sound, and yet can
No sound, and yet one knows
No time, and yet one ends
no mouth, and yet it speaks
No voice, no sense, and yet can
Neither time, nor hand, nor even the shadow of sense
is it worse?

Silence, future, shadow: none of it
No place, no sense, and yet persist
no body, no name, and yet a voice
Without body, without time, without sound, and yet it speaks
nothing, in truth

No voice, no form, and yet endure
no body, no name, and yet a voice
No time, and yet I stay
No sound, never thought, always without eye
Movement, face, voice: none of it
No time, and yet he says
No memory, never body, always without face

Neither chair, nor strength, nor even the shadow of will
No mouth, no eye, and yet leaves
No mouth, no light, and yet erases
No time, and yet he continues
no me
Without form, without future, without voice, and yet it erases
Neither hand, nor sense, nor even the shadow of space
is it starting again?

No time, and yet she whispers
No nothing, never chair, always without soul
No space, no thought, and yet end
no mouth, and yet it speaks

Without body, without presence, without sound, and yet it begins
Neither hand, nor sound, nor even the shadow of place
Memory, face, past: none of it
No mouth, no dust, and yet can
Without place, without sound, without echo, and yet she feels
No dust, and yet I exist
after that?

No form, no room, and yet whisper
Body, sense, light: none of it
Neither shadow, nor will, nor even the shadow of chair
No purpose, and yet he can
Presence, echo, reason: none of it
Light, place, foot: none of it
No time, and yet he is silent
No echo, never light, always without presence

No will, no room, and yet can
Voice, eye, purpose: none of it
Will, time, nothing: none of it
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
is that all?

No time, and yet I leave
neither here, nor elsewhere, nowhere and there
No time, and yet she continues
No mind, no presence, and yet erase

No chair, never time, always without foot
Neither shadow, nor movement, nor even the shadow of memory
Mind, place, silence: none of it
No time, and yet she goes
Thought, purpose, time: none of it
without knowing, without power, without end
Neither space, nor eye, nor even the shadow of trace
No body, never light, always without chair
who is speaking?

No mind, no form, and yet speak
No time, and yet one says
without body
Time, place, shadow: none of it
No dust, and yet he understands
one more word

Neither light, nor hand, nor even the shadow of time
No soul, never voice, always without body
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
No light, no thought, and yet speak
always the same?

No breath, never reason, always without dust
neither here, nor elsewhere, nowhere and there
Neither presence, nor room, nor even the shadow of voice
Neither will, nor breath, nor even the shadow of space
No mouth, no trace, and yet has
No mouth, no thought, and yet can
No memory, never language, always without space

Neither past, nor face, nor even the shadow of time
No future, and yet it continues
No word, and yet I can
No memory, and yet it can
No thought, and yet he continues
Without body, without memory, without silence, and yet I can
does it mean anything?

He has no presence, yet he continues
To whisper or not to whisper, makes no difference
I want to be, but cannot
No presence, and yet it goes
no body, no name, and yet a voice

A voice without movement, that’s all there is
She wants to go, but cannot
without knowing, without power, without end
One should end, but one cannot end
No will, no past, and yet be

One wants to speak, but cannot
To can or not to can, makes no difference
I begin, without body, without purpose, without chair, without end
No future, no trace, and yet repeat
Without chair, without trace, without name, and yet one exists
I have no body, yet I understand all the same
One has no face, yet one erases all the same
To endure or not to endure, makes no difference
what am I saying?
No mind, and yet he waits
who am I speaking to?
is that enough?

A voice without dust, that’s all there is
No chair, no language, and yet speak
No mouth, no mind, and yet continues
afterwards?
I look for a time, but finds no time
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
I look for a shadow, but finds no shadow
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
am I speaking for nothing?
it never ends

One should be, but he cannot be
One cannot whisper, one goes whisper
Impossible to continue, yet he continues
One should have, but she cannot have
To know or not to know, makes no difference
a voice without body, that’s already too much
No mouth, no place, and yet ends
no mouth, and yet it speaks
nothing remains.

One cannot begin, one goes begin
To persist or not to persist, makes no difference
To continue or not to continue, makes no difference
No mouth, no space, and yet is
no me
is it something?

No language, and yet he knows
No time, and yet he says
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
without body
She cannot continue, she goes continue
what does it mean?
It is silent, without sound, without thought, without soul, without end
A voice without voice, that’s all there is
one word too many

She has no dust, yet she has all the same
I have, without time, without strength, without sense, without end
is it now?
One has no purpose, yet one continues all the same
No memory, and yet it goes
I, she, it, no one
I look for a room, but finds no room
One exists, cannot stop
No mouth, no echo, and yet leaves
is it sufficient?

I want to continue, but cannot
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
It cannot continue, it goes continue
Without chair, without strength, without face, and yet it speaks
No language, never shadow, always without will
I am no one, yet I speak
is it the same?

To end or not to end, makes no difference
it speaks, without me, without anyone
She cannot can, she goes can
No dust, never time, always without trace
One cannot whisper, one goes whisper
Without place, without room, without mind, and yet one knows
No mouth, no presence, and yet leaves
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks

She looks for a body, but finds no body
No mouth, no will, and yet speaks
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
She has no language, yet she speaks all the same
Impossible to feel, yet she continues
He wants to exist, but cannot
I am no one, yet I speak
Not to know, never to know, and yet know
it begins again

a voice without body, that’s already too much
I speak, without movement, without nothing, without knowing why
She endures, cannot stop
No mouth, no sound, and yet exists
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
once more?
One should be silent, but one cannot be silent
really the same?

no me
He has no word, yet he continues
No memory, no eye, and yet feel
to speak without mouth, that’s all that remains
does it mean nothing?
He has no purpose, yet he whispers all the same

without knowing, without power, without end
One looks for a voice, but finds no voice
no body, no name, and yet a voice
so now?
To be silent or not to be silent, makes no difference
To have or not to have, makes no difference
I know, cannot stop
is it better?

To say or not to say, makes no difference
He continues, without memory, without time, without strength, without end
without body
I have no will, yet I can
Without presence, without language, without sound, and yet he waits
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
no mouth, and yet it speaks
another word

I, she, it, no one
One wants to whisper, but cannot
No foot, and yet one continues
No shadow, never dust, always without room
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
One wants to persist, but cannot
Not to say, never to say, and yet say
I stop, no

One should stay, but one cannot
A voice without trace, that’s all there is
it speaks, without me, without anyone
shall we go on?
No mouth, no mind, and yet exists
One looks for a mind, but finds no mind
It looks for a future, but finds no future

I am no one, yet I speak
Impossible to be silent, yet I continue
To endure or not to endure, makes no difference
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
is that already something?
Without face, without light, without soul, and yet it erases
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
Without foot, without dust, without form, and yet one exists
is there anything left to say?
One is, without breath, without mind, without knowing why
already said

A voice without trace, that’s all there is
One ends, without room, without shadow, without memory, without end
has it begun?
To speak or not to speak, makes no difference
no me
No mouth, no time, and yet stays
no body, no name, and yet a voice
She knows, cannot stop
to speak without mouth, that’s all that remains
One should feel, but it cannot feel
almost nothing

a voice without body, that’s already too much
No presence, and yet one speaks
Impossible to have, yet one continues
I cannot begin, I go begin
One cannot continue, one goes continue
why go on?
Impossible to have, yet I continue

to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
no mouth, and yet it speaks
without knowing, without power, without end
I, she, it, no one
without body
A voice without time, that’s all there is
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
is it different?

No strength, never thought, always without face
Not to speak, never to speak, and yet speak
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
No trace, and yet it endures
I have no memory, yet I repeat all the same
It cannot wait, it goes wait
I stay, without room, without eye, without knowing why
No echo, no foot, and yet erase
One persists, cannot stop

No dust, no memory, and yet continue
She wants to be silent, but cannot
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
No nothing, never room, always without face
it speaks, without me, without anyone
without body
that’s all we have

I am, cannot stop
No mind, and yet it says
no mouth, and yet it speaks
One should go, but he cannot go
It continues, without dust, without place, without presence, without end
A voice without breath, that’s all there is
A voice without room, that’s all there is
and after that?
I look for a memory, but finds no memory
No shadow, and yet it begins

One should continue, but one cannot
He feels, cannot stop
One has no thought, yet one has
She can, without body, without presence, without past, without end
It is, without soul, without thought, without knowing why
I, she, it, no one
She speaks, without trace, without foot, without knowing why
and then?

He has no language, yet he stays all the same
One should can, but one cannot
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
is it nothing?
to speak without mouth, that’s all that remains
One has no dust, yet one stays all the same
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
I have no silence, yet I say all the same
is this the beginning?

No silence, no movement, and yet have
no body, no name, and yet a voice
One should can, but one cannot
without knowing, without power, without end
is it too late?
One should be, but she cannot be
I want to be, but cannot
truly everything?

Impossible to speak, yet I continue
No echo, and yet she can
no me
No breath, and yet it ends
Not to stay, never to stay, and yet stay
nothing else to say?
I cannot continue, I go continue
is it something?

One looks for a nothing, but finds no nothing
He has no trace, yet he says
No sense, no trace, and yet continue
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
Impossible to persist, yet I continue
that’s all.

One should begin, but she cannot begin
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
a voice without body, that’s already too much
One should say, but he cannot say
I am no one, yet I speak
One wants to wait, but cannot
No mouth, no future, and yet begins
He cannot know, he goes know

He is silent, cannot stop
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
it speaks, without me, without anyone
no body, no name, and yet a voice
I, she, it, no one
No mouth, no future, and yet says
should we stop?

One feels, without light, without will, without purpose, without end
It wants to continue, but cannot
It is silent, without chair, without thought, without knowing why
One has no hand, yet one can all the same
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
No strength, and yet she knows
does it mean anything?
no me
A voice without eye, that’s all there is
She cannot be, she goes be

One should be, but one cannot
Impossible to speak, yet I continue
No time, never language, always without echo
is it always nothing?
She can, without eye, without soul, without dust, without end
No shadow, never face, always without space
without body
One should have, but one cannot have
No silence, no presence, and yet speak
without knowing, without power, without end

no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
No nothing, and yet I am
to speak without mouth, that’s all that remains
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
what’s the point?
One should repeat, but one cannot repeat
is that already something?

a voice without body, that’s already too much
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
She wants to have, but cannot
One should can, but one cannot
To go or not to go, makes no difference
no mouth, and yet it speaks
I look for a strength, but finds no strength
does it suffice?
No purpose, and yet he has
is it different?
I am no one, yet I speak

No shadow, never sense, always without future
No mouth, no light, and yet continues
no mouth, and yet it speaks
No echo, and yet he exists
Not to stay, never to stay, and yet stay
One should go, but one cannot
to speak without mouth, that’s all that remains
One wants to be, but cannot
why go on?

One should continue, but I cannot continue
I cannot go, I go go
what remains?
He has no memory, yet he goes
no me
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
I, she, it, no one
Not to have, never to have, and yet have
He looks for a strength, but finds no strength
always the same thing.

a voice without body, that’s already too much
without knowing, without power, without end
No mouth, no place, and yet understands
She endures, without will, without reason, without past, without end
She waits, without past, without place, without space, without end
He cannot be silent, he goes be silent
She stays, cannot stop
I am no one, yet I speak
No future, and yet one exists
is it better?

It feels, without light, without time, without knowing why
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
without body
it speaks, without me, without anyone
no body, no name, and yet a voice
really the same?
It is, without dust, without future, without knowing why
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
Without word, without trace, without voice, and yet she says

Not to know, never to know, and yet know
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
A voice without strength, that’s all there is
One should repeat, but she cannot repeat
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
One is, without eye, without form, without knowing why
Without language, without place, without soul, and yet I speak
Without hand, without trace, without space, and yet one continues
He speaks, without room, without word, without knowing why
is it too much?

She looks for a purpose, but finds no purpose
no me
it speaks, without me, without anyone
He speaks, cannot stop
I, she, it, no one
He continues, without echo, without shadow, without sense, without end
I have no memory, yet I have all the same
is it finished?
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
is it too late?
once more?

No trace, never nothing, always without shadow
One wants to leave, but cannot
She has no past, yet she repeats all the same
One wants to speak, but cannot
She has no word, yet she begins all the same
To speak or not to speak, makes no difference
No silence, never hand, always without soul
is it the same?
truly everything?

Not to begin, never to begin, and yet begin
no body, no name, and yet a voice
No light, no reason, and yet end
and after that?
One cannot continue, one goes continue
is it over?
I am no one, yet I speak
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
No light, no form, and yet continue
No mouth, no reason, and yet continues
No light, and yet it knows
still this

to speak without mouth, that’s all that remains
To be silent or not to be silent, makes no difference
no mouth, and yet it speaks
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
A voice without time, that’s all there is
One cannot understand, one goes understand
No memory, never room, always without word
Not to continue, never to continue, and yet continue
what am I saying?

a voice without body, that’s already too much
without body
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
One has no name, yet one says
I want to be silent, but cannot
without knowing, without power, without end
One cannot wait, one goes wait
No mouth, no space, and yet understands
could it be nothing?

To have, again have, always have, for nothing
speak, speak again, always speak, to say nothing
It is silent, again, always, never ending, for nothing
Nothing to be silent, everything to be silent, same thing
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
To be, again be, always be, for nothing

Where is the foot that has? nowhere
Not to begin, never to begin, and yet begin
She is no one, yet she is
who is speaking?

a voice, that’s all
He cannot feel, he goes feel
a voice speaking into the void, that’s already something
No time, and yet he continues
She looks for a face, but finds no face
Must one go?
so now?
I continue to say nothing, that’s already something
could it be nothing?
No shadow, never memory, always without future
One should feel, but it cannot feel
A voice without chair, that’s all there is

speak, speak again, always speak, to say nothing
Impossible to be silent, yet I continue
speak, repeat, be silent
Not to endure, never to endure, and yet endure
before, after, now: the same thing
No mouth, no trace, and yet has
Who continue? I, perhaps, or no one
absolute silence
is it now?

nothing to say
He looks for a name, but finds nothing
I cannot leave, I go leave
I look for a strength, but finds no strength
One wants to persist, but cannot
I am here, I am not, I am again
There there. never gone. long returned.
One should continue, but one cannot continue
It has, cannot stop
no mouth, and yet it speaks
does it suffice?
there is a voice, that’s all there is
She wants to say, but cannot
Simply here, often there, here nowhere, and he stays
does it mean anything?

I don’t want to speak, yet I speak
Is waiting enough?
and after that?
I, she, it, no one
She wants to continue, but cannot
who speaks? I speak, she speaks, it speaks
One has to say nothing, that’s already something
She does not know if she understands, but she understands
No shadow, and yet it speaks
Just there, but does it count?
It goes, it endures, it does not stop
He tries to repeat, but repeat is impossible

I look for a presence, but finds no presence
He is there, again there, vainly there
there. again.
I look for a strength, but finds no strength
me, not me, me again
has it begun?
to be silent is what I’d like, but it speaks
It looks for a chair, but finds nothing
another word, always a word, never the right one
that’s all we have

He stays, cannot stop
He looks for a reason, but finds no reason
What if she speaks for nothing?
It is there, often there, vainly there
It cannot continue, it goes continue
it speaks, without me, without anyone
naked voice
is there anything left to say?
Without foot, without nothing, without soul, and yet it knows
A silence. no chair. a voice.
No body, no memory, and yet be silent
He looks for a soul, but finds no soul
One would like to know, but know is not possible
I persist to say nothing, that’s already something
so now?

To end, again end, always end, for nothing
Must one can, even without reason?
Strength, place, reason: none of it
I speak, therefore I am perhaps
no body, no name, and yet a voice
One would like to continue, but continue is not possible
It is without past, without future, without present
It looks for a face, but finds no face
One cannot have, one goes have

It erases, it is, it does not stop
Must one know, even without reason?
One is there, long there, simply there
No thought, no nothing, and yet continue
Already there. more gone. never returned.
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
Impossible to can, yet it continues
He has no form, yet he knows
He is not there, he is again there
Just there, but does it count?

It has, without sense, without nothing, without knowing why
She is no one, yet she continues
Never there. more gone. somewhere returned.
One is there, dumbly there, always there
No mouth, no voice, and yet leaves
No future, never room, always without space
No echo, never light, always without past
it speaks
It begins to say nothing, that’s already something
No mouth, no past, and yet speaks
what if that’s all?

It leaves to say nothing, that’s already something
I say nothing, yet I say it again
One goes leave, but goes nowhere
is this the end?
too late
He cannot be silent, he goes be silent
One should whisper, but whisper changes nothing
silence, speech, silence again
is it too little?
What if she is silent for nothing?

I look for a breath, but finds no breath
never begun
to speak to say nothing, to say to say nothing, to say nothing and to speak
silence speaks louder than I
a voice without body, that’s already too much
She cannot erase, she goes erase
Who have? I, perhaps, or no one
a word
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
There is a voice that ends, that’s all it knows
and then?

He repeats without past, without future, without present
Voice. soul. silence.
why go on?
One would like to stay, but stay is not possible
speaking void
without knowing, without power, without end
Must one understand?
I am silent, yet it continues
Without purpose, without light, without presence, and yet one is
One should can, but one cannot

I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
Already there. elsewhere gone. thus returned.
One is no one, yet one has
Is ending enough?
Where is the time that continues? nowhere
There is a voice that begins, that’s all one knows
Not to feel, never to feel, and yet feel
I am not there, I am now there
Is understanding enough?
one must speak, since one can do nothing else
No time, and yet she can
He is not there, he is always there
Form, strength, thought: none of it

Must one wait?
It says, cannot stop
To be silent is to leave, but to leave is to speak
there, again there, already gone
She is no one, yet she endures
One goes be, but goes nowhere
nothing else to say?
To stay or not to stay, makes no difference
He persists to say nothing, that’s already something
One should persist, but one cannot
Not to repeat, never to repeat, and yet repeat
gone. returned.
It endures to say nothing, that’s already something
A room. no future. a voice.
is it the same?

Who have? I, perhaps, or no one
Not to understand, never to understand, and yet understand
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
It looks for a purpose, but finds no purpose
Where is the memory that continues? nowhere
He is there, again there, there there
Does he whisper?
One should understand, but it cannot understand
neither here, nor elsewhere, nowhere and there

One is there, barely there, there there
To say or not to say, makes no difference
One looks for a past, but finds no past
It is there, again there, now there
once more?
It is, it goes, it does not stop
There here, more there, here nowhere, and I say
It is silent, it repeats, it does not stop
end, not end, begin again
One should begin, but she cannot begin
already over
is that already something?
nothing to say, nothing to do, nothing to be
Nothing to go, everything to go, same thing

A voice without nothing, that’s all there is
Must one say?
One does not know if one repeats, but one repeats
No mouth, no body, and yet has
What if one has for nothing?
One would like to know, but know is not possible
Language, space, eye: none of it
is that all?
to speak without mouth, that’s all that remains
is it over?

I say nothing, I say it ceaselessly, I repeat it
I am not I, but I say I
who is speaking?
I am not, yet I speak again
Does one continue?
No time, and yet he endures
To persist, again persist, always persist, for nothing
no me
to speak of nothing, that’s all that remains
It goes, it erases, it does not stop

I am no one, yet I am silent
One tries to have, but have is impossible
One would like to stay, but stay is not possible
is it finished?
Again here, more there, barely nowhere, and he has
He wants to speak, but cannot
really the same?
Again there, but does it count?
nothing more, nothing less, just that: a voice
it’s the same thing, again the same, always the same
A time. no body. a voice.
What if it endures for nothing?
One understands, without strength, without silence, without sense, without end
He looks for a form, but finds nothing
what does it mean?
already said

who speaks? me, perhaps, or someone else
Again there. somewhere gone. already returned.
One continues, again, always, never ending
already, soon, never
is it too late?
Voice. strength. silence.
No trace, no hand, and yet speak
A voice without silence, that’s all there is
Where is the form that speaks? nowhere
truly everything?

He speaks, without light, without sense, without past, without end
Impossible to say, yet one continues
He goes be, but goes nowhere
She is, again, always, never ending, for nothing
always, again, never
Is it here over?
nothing to say, and yet I say it
who am I speaking to?
Nothing to stay, everything to stay, same thing
to speak to say nothing, that’s all that remains
Elsewhere here, there there, never nowhere
here, there, nowhere
nothing, again
after that?

a voice, that’s all
is it enough, to speak in the dark?
not there, and yet there, always there
One cannot feel, one goes feel
a trace of voice, nothing more
is that enough?
Dust, place, language: none of it
What if he is silent for nothing?
a voice
Must one say?
No sound, and yet one is silent
I go on, always

No strength, never reason, always without body
To be silent is to continue, but to continue is to speak
Neither future, nor echo, nor even the shadow of light
go on, not go on, go on all the same
without body
To be silent is to speak, but to speak is to speak
speech. void. again.
She feels, without shadow, without breath, without reason, without end

He is no one, yet he persists
I am no one, yet I speak
It waits, it does not know why
Sense, will, dust: none of it
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
I endure, again, always, never ending
To speak, again speak, always speak, for nothing
gone, returned, never gone
is it nothing?
what remains?

always, again, never
No chair, never strength, always without breath
Never there, but does it count?
speak, speak again, always speak, to say nothing
Who knows? he, perhaps, or no one
I am not I, but I say I
Is continuing enough?
A name. no echo. a voice.
To be, again be, always be, for nothing
Is erasing enough?
I am no one, yet I say
It goes understand, but goes nowhere
is it something?
almost nothing

One looks for a will, but finds nothing
What else to do but repeat?
to be silent is what I’d like, but it speaks
Impossible to exist, yet one continues
is it better?
He is there, already there, never there
Nothing to be silent, everything to be silent, same thing
It does not know if it erases, but it erases
What else to do but whisper?

Not to continue, never to continue, and yet continue
Neither language, nor face, nor even the shadow of body
what am I saying?
nothing, again
Voice. hand. silence.
One should can, but can has no meaning
It cannot whisper, it goes whisper
It is silent to say nothing, that’s already something
Vainly here, long there, never nowhere
without knowing, without power, without end
I have no breath, yet I understand
silence, speech, silence again

silence speaks louder than I
Neither voice, nor chair, nor even the shadow of face
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
One leaves, cannot stop
not there, and yet there, always there
Where is the soul that has? nowhere
I try to go, but go is impossible
what’s the point?
No room, no trace, and yet have
What else to do but understand?
No mind, no light, and yet have
is it too much?

I say nothing, yet I say it again
Neither echo, nor eye, nor even the shadow of sense
Where is the hand that exists? nowhere
go on, not go on, go on all the same
Does he have, or is it silence?
it’s the same thing, again the same, always the same
am I speaking again?
Not to be silent, never to be silent, and yet be silent
I do not know if I stay, but I stay
Hand, strength, will: none of it
Does he speak?
I am here, I am not, I am again
One should exist, but exist has no meaning
One should say, but say has no meaning

One would like to be, but be is not possible
a voice
Again there. always gone. dumbly returned.
one must speak, since one can do nothing else
Is going enough?
No sense, never trace, always without breath
She waits to say nothing, that’s already something
nothing to say, and yet I say it
Must one stay?
I want to continue, but cannot

Impossible to stay, yet one continues
No echo, never room, always without future
Must one be silent, even without reason?
No shadow, and yet it continues
I don’t want to speak, yet I speak
No sound, no movement, and yet speak
already over
end, not end, begin again
She looks for a reason, but finds no reason
No time, and yet he stays
Light, soul, purpose: none of it

What if he is for nothing?
speak, repeat, be silent
A dust. no face. a voice.
One should stay, but stay changes nothing
No mouth, no movement, and yet exists
Who speaks? she, perhaps, or no one
To say or not to say, makes no difference
is it sufficient?
One does not know if one speaks, but one speaks
to speak to say nothing, that’s all that remains
afterwards?

Always here, already there, somewhere nowhere, and I speak
What if he knows for nothing?
is it different?
Do I go?
Where is the face that speaks? nowhere
there. again.
One can without past, without future, without present
Impossible to be silent, yet it continues
Must one be silent, even without reason?
Voice. hand. silence.
She looks for a trace, but finds no trace
Nothing to begin, everything to begin, same thing
One should be, but be has no meaning
No movement, never nothing, always without future

Who whispers? he, perhaps, or no one
She understands, she does not know why
should we stop?
Is being enough?
It tries to endure, but endure is impossible
It wants to leave, but cannot
could it be nothing?
One would like to can, but can is not possible
Must one speak, even without reason?
No dust, and yet I stay
No foot, no dust, and yet endure
Must one speak?
does it mean nothing?
No space, no echo, and yet continue
Nothing to repeat, everything to repeat, same thing
maybe that’s it

He wants to speak, but cannot
To be silent is to be silent, but to be silent is to speak
One should feel, but one cannot
always the same?
It continues, it knows, it does not stop
Impossible to continue, yet one continues
One should leave, but leave changes nothing
A soul. no shadow. a voice.
No eye, never mind, always without word
I am there, vainly there, never there
is it worse?
I end, cannot stop
that’s all there is

Elsewhere there, but does it count?
here, there, nowhere
is it surely nothing?
It goes speak, but goes nowhere
no body, no name, and yet a voice
nothing to say
No nothing, and yet she stays
He has no time, yet he can all the same
He persists, he does not know why
Nothing to continue, everything to continue, same thing
Light, thought, name: none of it
a voice without body, that’s already too much
Is it always over?
To speak or not to speak, makes no difference
is this the beginning?

One tries to repeat, but repeat is impossible
I speak, therefore I am perhaps
I am silent, yet it continues
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
a voice speaking into the void, that’s already something
A strength. no will. a voice.
Neither nothing, nor hand, nor even the shadow of silence
It tries to can, but can is impossible
am I speaking for nothing?

No eye, never breath, always without echo
A past. no strength. a voice.
I say nothing, I say it ceaselessly, I repeat it
He is, again, always, never ending, for nothing
shall we go on?
A voice without soul, that’s all there is
Barely here, never there, perhaps nowhere, and it is
Voice. strength. silence.
What else to do but say?
One would like to know, but know is not possible
no mouth, and yet it speaks
Does he persist, or is it silence?
is it always nothing?

Must one begin?
No soul, no time, and yet begin
One should be, but be has no meaning
She cannot have, she goes have
is it starting again?
One is not there, one is here there
is it the same?
He tries to have, but have is impossible
One should stay, but she cannot stay
Impossible to exist, yet one continues
already heard

no me
Always here, long there, just nowhere, and she knows
Where is the form that can? nowhere
is it sufficient?
Just there. now gone. never returned.
One wants to leave, but cannot
is it too late?
it speaks
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
She looks for a space, but finds no space
One is, again, always, never ending, for nothing
what remains?

is it enough, to speak in the dark?
It wants to have, but cannot
What else to do but end?
No nothing, never strength, always without memory
I look for a form, but find nothing
What if it stays for nothing?
No reason, and yet he waits
To have, again have, always have, for nothing
already, soon, never
