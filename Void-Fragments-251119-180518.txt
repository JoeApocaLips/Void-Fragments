No thought, no light, and yet speak
No will, and yet he knows
No space, and yet it speaks
No mouth, no foot, and yet endures
is it too late?
Without eye, without face, without name, and yet I stay

No face, never shadow, always without nothing
No movement, no room, and yet whisper
No mouth, no body, and yet is silent
No soul, and yet one whispers
again this

Time, breath, language: none of it
No voice, and yet she ends
Without movement, without sound, without language, and yet she stays
No form, no reason, and yet speak
Without place, without dust, without face, and yet it continues
is this the beginning?

No memory, and yet it stays
Neither dust, nor space, nor even the shadow of chair
No time, and yet she waits
without body

No mouth, no strength, and yet is silent
No memory, no trace, and yet speak
Neither room, nor language, nor even the shadow of trace
No time, and yet he erases
No mouth, no memory, and yet persists
No breath, no soul, and yet speak
to speak without mouth, that’s all that remains
Neither future, nor room, nor even the shadow of dust
Is existing enough?

Thought, trace, room: none of it
without knowing, without power, without end
Neither movement, nor shadow, nor even the shadow of foot
No mouth, no breath, and yet has
Neither time, nor will, nor even the shadow of name
is it surely nothing?

Without light, without past, without will, and yet one leaves
No place, never purpose, always without face
Neither past, nor thought, nor even the shadow of mind
No word, never will, always without nothing
Neither shadow, nor face, nor even the shadow of form
No reason, no presence, and yet erase
No voice, and yet it goes
is this the end?

Without presence, without place, without silence, and yet he endures
a presence without body, that’s already too much
Without time, without chair, without sense, and yet I speak
No body, never light, always without trace
No trace, and yet he is

No sound, and yet I am silent
No mouth, no shadow, and yet ends
it speaks, without me, without anyone
No reason, and yet he says
is it worse?

No word, never will, always without nothing
without memory, without trace, and yet I know
Foot, dust, thought: none of it
No time, and yet I leave
it whispers, without ear, without echo, without end
Neither purpose, nor room, nor even the shadow of foot
No time, and yet it ends
Without sound, without word, without dust, and yet she is silent
could it be nothing?

No future, no dust, and yet speak
Place, will, hand: none of it
a voice without body, that’s already too much
No hand, and yet one knows
No space, and yet she says
No time, and yet I am
No trace, never body, always without silence
what if that’s all?

Foot, eye, language: none of it
No thought, and yet it is silent
No silence, no face, and yet whisper
Without hand, without movement, without thought, and yet she stays
Without presence, without reason, without trace, and yet I feel
No time, and yet he feels
No face, no nothing, and yet whisper
No voice, no memory, and yet speak
is that enough?

Movement, foot, voice: none of it
Without soul, without mind, without face, and yet she repeats
No mind, no light, and yet be
No time, and yet she speaks
No trace, no breath, and yet leave
Echo, sense, body: none of it
No time, and yet she says
what remains?

Neither time, nor face, nor even the shadow of movement
Body, sense, chair: none of it
No time, and yet he is silent
No will, no place, and yet can
Neither silence, nor will, nor even the shadow of presence
almost nothing

No time, and yet it has
No presence, no dust, and yet can
No chair, no language, and yet wait
Neither foot, nor past, nor even the shadow of breath
no body, no name, and yet a voice
No room, and yet it erases
No time, and yet I can
after that?

she persists, without reason, without end
Place, soul, movement: none of it
No presence, never thought, always without name
No breath, never face, always without foot
Without word, without chair, without movement, and yet she persists
is it sufficient?

No time, and yet she speaks
No memory, no space, and yet endure
No mouth, no form, and yet continues
No time, and yet he whispers
Without thought, without mind, without silence, and yet it knows
once again.

Movement, echo, will: none of it
No sense, never voice, always without space
Neither foot, nor will, nor even the shadow of past
No thought, and yet she speaks
No place, no word, and yet can
Neither language, nor light, nor even the shadow of eye

Without body, without hand, without shadow, and yet one leaves
No mouth, no future, and yet leaves
Light, place, future: none of it
no me
No light, and yet he whispers
should we stop?

Neither face, nor sound, nor even the shadow of place
Without foot, without silence, without face, and yet she speaks
No nothing, never silence, always without memory
Without sense, without soul, without past, and yet he has
Is being silent enough?

Room, thought, voice: none of it
No language, no hand, and yet be silent
a shadow without light, that’s all there is
No time, and yet it can
Neither form, nor sense, nor even the shadow of shadow

No purpose, and yet one is
No soul, and yet he goes
Neither name, nor breath, nor even the shadow of eye
No time, and yet it can

No silence, never place, always without sense
No mouth, no foot, and yet has
No reason, and yet it goes
to whisper without breath, that’s all there is
what’s the point?

No light, no trace, and yet repeat
Neither thought, nor face, nor even the shadow of past
No eye, and yet he has
No mouth, no time, and yet says
Without echo, without mind, without memory, and yet he continues
No mouth, no light, and yet says
Neither shadow, nor form, nor even the shadow of sense
No time, and yet it has
is it better?

Without body, without shadow, without breath, and yet he exists
No mouth, no language, and yet begins
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
No time, and yet I whisper
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks

No soul, never body, always without reason
No shadow, no hand, and yet repeat
No time, and yet it speaks
No dust, and yet one speaks
Neither language, nor foot, nor even the shadow of movement
Without eye, without foot, without past, and yet one leaves
No mouth, no chair, and yet has
is there anything left to say?

No nothing, no name, and yet say
No soul, never sense, always without will
Without place, without language, without reason, and yet it erases
has it begun?
No mouth, no memory, and yet is
No eye, never trace, always without time
No mouth, no breath, and yet is silent
No trace, no room, and yet whisper

Face, past, hand: none of it
No thought, and yet he whispers
No time, and yet one leaves
neither here, nor elsewhere, nowhere and there
Without eye, without hand, without presence, and yet she feels
Word, future, nothing: none of it
he stays, without place, without name, without why
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
is it something?

No time, and yet she leaves
No language, never breath, always without name
No language, and yet one stays
neither here, nor elsewhere, nowhere and there
Echo, soul, past: none of it
no me
No foot, no shadow, and yet be
No past, never name, always without sense

No mind, and yet he erases
No language, never word, always without time
a shadow without light, that’s all there is
Without shadow, without echo, without sound, and yet one says
No eye, never body, always without language
no body, no name, and yet a voice
is it over?

No breath, no foot, and yet whisper
No mouth, no future, and yet exists
Neither face, nor form, nor even the shadow of eye
No future, and yet I speak
No mouth, no strength, and yet has
No mouth, no past, and yet can
No nothing, no sound, and yet wait

No memory, and yet she is
No room, never face, always without movement
No mouth, no mind, and yet continues
No soul, never memory, always without foot
always the same?

No language, and yet one leaves
No purpose, and yet it endures
Without room, without sound, without silence, and yet it knows
No time, and yet he repeats
Neither breath, nor chair, nor even the shadow of purpose

Neither memory, nor word, nor even the shadow of sound
No dust, no body, and yet can
Trace, breath, foot: none of it
Without eye, without purpose, without past, and yet I speak
No memory, never dust, always without language

Trace, breath, time: none of it
No memory, never word, always without sound
No nothing, and yet I have
Name, mind, silence: none of it
No form, never voice, always without presence
Neither purpose, nor sound, nor even the shadow of future

Neither silence, nor form, nor even the shadow of room
No thought, no foot, and yet persist
Neither foot, nor form, nor even the shadow of room
it speaks, without me, without anyone

It waits, without space, without silence, without form, without end
One is not there, one is again there
he stays, without place, without name, without why
No time, and yet he continues
who am I speaking to?

Does she stay, or is it silence?
It has to say nothing, that’s already something
No eye, and yet he feels
here, there, nowhere
I am silent, yet it continues
what remains?
It does not know if it speaks, but it speaks
He says, without voice, without body, without hand, without end
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
It looks for a room, but finds no room
One should know, but she cannot know
One should have, but one cannot
nothing more.

Impossible to know, yet it continues
a shadow without light, that’s all there is
Impossible to end, yet it continues
I try to can, but can is impossible
No mouth, no echo, and yet speaks
Not to be, never to be, and yet be
why go on?
I repeat to say nothing, that’s already something
Nothing to can, everything to can, same thing
is this the end?
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
I am not there, I am elsewhere there
She has no strength, yet she can
afterwards?
I go on, always

A voice without time, that’s all there is
She whispers without past, without future, without present
No foot, no past, and yet stay
A form. no soul. a voice.
is it now?
He is no one, yet he ends
one repeats to say nothing, that’s already something
a trace of voice, nothing more
She is silent, she does not know why
it speaks, without me, without anyone
It cannot whisper, it goes whisper
after that?

Where is the dust that feel? nowhere
Who waits? he, perhaps, or no one
No time, and yet she continues
Must one stay?
She goes, again, always, never ending, for nothing
No mouth, no chair, and yet goes
I have no past, yet I repeat
Where is the place that whisper? nowhere
Must one mean, even without sense?

I am not I, but I say I
Voice. reason. silence.
She is there, never there, again there
One should can, but can has no meaning
One should go, but go changes nothing
What else to do but understand?
Does silence count as speaking?
He speaks without past, without future, without present
Is going enough?
To be silent is to end, but to end is to speak
A voice without time, that’s all there is
is it too little?

One should know, but know has no meaning
Neither soul, nor language, nor even the shadow of presence
One is there, more there, barely there
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
a voice, that’s all
there, again there, already gone
A place. no will. a voice.
once more?
nothing, again
To be silent is to can, but to can is to speak
could it be nothing?
Name, soul, chair: none of it
Is being silent enough?
Who wait? I, perhaps, or no one
No place, never presence, always without word
who is speaking?
already gone.

Vainly there, but does it count?
I look for a silence, but finds no silence
not there, and yet there, always there
He goes begin, but goes nowhere
a voice without body, that’s already too much
I go be silent, but go nowhere
Sound, nothing, strength: none of it
A future. no word. a voice.
No time, and yet one ends
One is without past, without future, without present
to speak of nothing, that’s all that remains
I continue, I do not know why

He cannot stay, he goes stay
To say or not to say, makes no difference
is it surely nothing?
Impossible to leave, yet he continues
what if that’s all?
She is there, often there, always there
it speaks
One is silent, again, always, never ending, for nothing
is it sufficient?
No reason, never form, always without eye
She says, cannot stop
Without soul, without place, without hand, and yet one begins
Simply here, more there, almost nowhere

Long there. again gone. perhaps returned.
to speak to say nothing, that’s all that remains
Nothing to know, everything to know, same thing
Without silence, without name, without thought, and yet he continues
No space, and yet one erases
No language, never purpose, always without trace
One should understand, but it cannot understand
I exist, I do not know why
truly everything?

Without place, without name, without voice, and yet she understands
One whispers, one does not know why
Who can? one, perhaps, or no one
before, after, now: the same thing
One would like to speak, but speak is not possible
She looks for a voice, but finds nothing
and after that?
Impossible to stay, yet it continues
is that already something?
Voice. echo. silence.
is it too late?

It wants to whisper, but cannot
One should endure, but endure has no meaning
He begins, cannot stop
Just there. again gone. thus returned.
Without shadow, without purpose, without breath, and yet she waits
really the same?
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
to speak to say nothing, to say to say nothing, to say nothing and to speak
She is silent, without room, without name, without space, without end
Nothing to end, everything to end, same thing
One would like to begin, but begin is not possible
One should speak, but speak changes nothing
does it mean nothing?

I am no one, yet I repeat
Does he go, or is it silence?
He endures, again, always, never ending, for nothing
a presence without body, that’s already too much
is it starting again?
Elsewhere there, but does it count?
what does it mean?
To end, again end, always end, for nothing
One whispers, again, always, never ending
One tries to speak, but speak is impossible
is it something?

Is it thus over?
One should continue, but he cannot continue
She has no room, yet she continues
is that all?
She goes go, but goes nowhere
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
One speaks, one does not know why
I am absent, yet present in speech
No mouth, no presence, and yet erases
It feels, again, always, never ending, for nothing
Not to erase, never to erase, and yet erase
What if she understands for nothing?
is it nothing?
One should continue, but continue has no meaning
Is repeating enough?

always, again, never
It waits to say nothing, that’s already something
I go say, but go nowhere
She looks for a form, but finds no form
nothing to say, and yet I say it
always the same?
One should stay, but she cannot stay
nothing to say
One should can, but can changes nothing
I have no breath, yet I speak all the same
is it better?
silence speaks louder than I
is this the beginning?

No time, and yet one is silent
Is it simply over?
go on, not go on, go on all the same
Already there, but does it count?
Does she be, or is it silence?
Here there, but does it count?
One does not know if one stays, but one stays
One should continue, but it cannot continue
shall we go on?

To understand or not to understand, makes no difference
Is speaking enough?
is it too much?
No trace, and yet she continues
One goes begin, but goes nowhere
He is no one, yet he repeats
To endure, again endure, always endure, for nothing
There is a voice that begins, that’s all it knows
One should be, but be has no meaning
One goes understand, but goes nowhere
what’s the point?
I am not, yet I speak again
No eye, never face, always without room
is it the same?
She is, without light, without nothing, without knowing why

It has, it is silent, it does not stop
To be silent is to continue, but to continue is to speak
gone, returned, never gone
I am there, thus there, again there
To stay, again stay, always stay, for nothing
already over
Does it say, or is it silence?
Is it often over?
is it finished?
One wants to continue, but cannot
without memory, without trace, and yet I know

I am silent, yet it continues
end, not end, begin again
it whispers, without ear, without echo, without end
Voice. future. silence.
It does not know if it is silent, but it is silent
is there anything left to say?
No mouth, no language, and yet understands
More there. always gone. perhaps returned.

Nothing to have, everything to have, same thing
Impossible to leave, yet I continue
To be silent is to end, but to end is to speak
Voice. reason. silence.

What if she continues for nothing?
Nothing to begin, everything to begin, same thing
no word, and yet it speaks ceaselessly
neither here, nor elsewhere, nowhere and there
am I speaking again?
to be silent is what I’d like, but it speaks
It looks for a dust, but finds no dust
No echo, no hand, and yet leave
Impossible to continue, yet one continues
No will, no silence, and yet have
that’s all.

Must one have, even without reason?
Must one exist?

without knowing, without power, without end
Again there. elsewhere gone. more returned.
Is repeating enough?
One can without past, without future, without present
Without light, without strength, without trace, and yet she waits
what am I saying?
Not to stay, never to stay, and yet stay

No purpose, never dust, always without will
Where is the will that continues? nowhere

Without voice, without form, without eye, and yet she exists
speaking void
Impossible to be, yet one continues
Voice. voice. silence.

to whisper without breath, that’s all there is
Nothing to leave, everything to leave, same thing
Is it often over?
To be silent is to whisper, but to whisper is to speak

Again there, but does it count?
No face, and yet it speaks
a voice speaking into the void, that’s already something
One looks for a purpose, but finds nothing
without body
It cannot continue, it goes continue
absolute silence
Nothing to endure, everything to endure, same thing
is it surely nothing?

He is not there, he is never there
To understand, again understand, always understand, for nothing
Is existing enough?
Breath, dust, room: none of it
is it too much?
Impossible to go, yet he continues
Does it leave, or is it silence?
one must speak, since one can do nothing else
She looks for a body, but finds nothing
she persists, without reason, without end
is it sufficient?
She endures, cannot stop
really the same?

Not to go, never to go, and yet go
I feel, again, always, never ending
am I speaking for nothing?
He is silent, without place, without name, without knowing why
am I speaking again?
She looks for a hand, but finds no hand
Who understands? he, perhaps, or no one
Long there. never gone. there returned.

One should can, but can changes nothing
One would like to stay, but stay is not possible
Does it speak, or is it silence?
What else to do but say?

Simply here, vainly there, never nowhere, and I persist
Does it say?

One should exist, but one cannot

No space, never soul, always without language

Is it barely over?
Again here, never there, often nowhere, and I endure
I go speak, but go nowhere
To continue, again continue, always continue, for nothing
is this the beginning?
She goes, cannot stop
One should can, but one cannot can
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
Does silence count as speaking?

He goes, again, always, never ending, for nothing
No mouth, no space, and yet waits
what’s the point?
It leaves, again, always, never ending, for nothing
is it the same?
It looks for a trace, but finds nothing

No purpose, never soul, always without breath
shall we go on?
Who continues? she, perhaps, or no one

A memory. no hand. a voice.
he stays, without place, without name, without why
Is it always over?
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
No memory, never place, always without silence
maybe that’s it

It speaks, it is, it does not stop
No space, never memory, always without dust
without knowing, without power, without end
I persist, without foot, without breath, without knowing why
who speaks? me, perhaps, or someone else
Impossible to say, yet I continue
Impossible to say, yet one continues
Must one feel, even without reason?
No time, never dust, always without name
is it too much?

I, she, it, no one
One is not there, one is thus there
Where is the shadow that repeats? nowhere
after that?
One should say, but say changes nothing
Again there, but does it count?
one repeats to say nothing, that’s already something
Already there. never gone. simply returned.
I am not there, I am barely there
is it always nothing?
No dust, never name, always without light

I am silent, yet it continues
silence, speech, silence again
One stays to say nothing, that’s already something
There is a voice that continues, that’s all I know
One should begin, but begin changes nothing
No time, and yet one continues
Neither shadow, nor past, nor even the shadow of name
He knows, again, always, never ending
is this the beginning?
Voice. soul. silence.
One should say, but say changes nothing
She does not know if she leaves, but she leaves
why go on?
She has no eye, yet she endures
what does it mean?

Always there, but does it count?
a shadow without light, that’s all there is
there, again there, already gone
nothing else to say?
nothing more, nothing less, just that: a voice
is it the same?
Must one whisper?
One continues, cannot stop
shall we go on?
Who endures? it, perhaps, or no one
another word, always a word, never the right one
Not to be, never to be, and yet be
One would like to can, but can is not possible
is it surely nothing?
I do not know if I continue, but I continue
and after that?

One has, without name, without space, without room, without end
To be silent, again be silent, always be silent, for nothing
It knows to say nothing, that’s already something
She continues, she does not know why
No future, never shadow, always without dust
He continues, he does not know why
No movement, and yet I stay
Impossible to be silent, yet he continues

There is a voice that understands, that’s all he knows
I want to continue, but cannot
A voice without reason, that’s all there is
What else to do but continue?
One should erase, but one cannot
A voice without foot, that’s all there is
To be silent is to be silent, but to be silent is to speak
No memory, no sense, and yet endure
She has, without voice, without reason, without knowing why
No time, and yet she can
is it nothing?

who speaks? I speak, she speaks, it speaks
One would like to be silent, but be silent is not possible
Is it barely over?
To whisper or not to whisper, makes no difference
Where is the body that whispers? nowhere
does it mean anything?
She is there, dumbly there, there there
I am silent, cannot stop
To be silent is to have, but to have is to speak
It is there, almost there, elsewhere there

One has no language, yet one continues all the same
nothing to say, nothing to do, nothing to be
One would like to be silent, but be silent is not possible
Who has? one, perhaps, or no one
already, soon, never
Elsewhere here, already there, often nowhere, and she says
It is there, again there, almost there
One should know, but know changes nothing
nothing, again
am I speaking for nothing?
does it mean nothing?

He persists, he does not know why
One would like to persist, but persist is not possible
Without breath, without room, without time, and yet it endures
No word, no soul, and yet continue
What else to do but erase?
Impossible to speak, yet it continues
What else to do but be?
One should be, but she cannot be
is it starting again?
One can, cannot stop
no word, and yet it speaks ceaselessly
I exist, again, always, never ending
She looks for a will, but finds no will
I stop, no

Not to exist, never to exist, and yet exist
I am not here, I am again there
She endures to say nothing, that’s already something
Without dust, without body, without voice, and yet I understand
Is repeating enough?
Again here, more there, just nowhere, and one has
to speak without mouth, that’s all that remains
It is not there, it is almost there
One has, without silence, without body, without knowing why

No mouth, no thought, and yet repeats
No body, no nothing, and yet be silent
silence speaks louder than I
is it too late?
Not to have, never to have, and yet have
a silence that speaks, that’s already something
He leaves, cannot stop
He is there, there there, again there
once more?
Is it always over?
No mouth, no echo, and yet persists

One is silent, again, always, never ending, for nothing
Here there. elsewhere gone. somewhere returned.
Who waits? one, perhaps, or no one
One should wait, but one cannot
Nothing to wait, everything to wait, same thing
A voice without sound, that’s all there is
it continues, again, always, never begun
really the same?
She is no one, yet she begins
does it suffice?
He has no breath, yet he whispers
One is no one, yet one speaks
One whispers without past, without future, without present
one must speak, since one can do nothing else
should we stop?
one more word

He endures, without name, without dust, without knowing why
I try to continue, but continue is impossible
A voice without place, that’s all there is
It persists, it continues, it does not stop
No time, and yet one is silent
He tries to understand, but understand is impossible
Nothing to know, everything to know, same thing
is it something?
I say without past, without future, without present
am I speaking again?
A name. no place. a voice.

Again here, vainly there, barely nowhere, and she speaks
To be silent is to stay, but to stay is to speak
a presence without body, that’s already too much
Neither face, nor chair, nor even the shadow of eye
To feel or not to feel, makes no difference
Does silence count as speaking?
Does it wait, or is it silence?
I am not there, I am often there
is there anything left to say?
More here, always there, simply nowhere
To be silent is to whisper, but to whisper is to speak
Without light, without reason, without thought, and yet it persists
What if it continues for nothing?

Where is the language that have? nowhere
To begin, again begin, always begin, for nothing
A trace. no sense. a voice.
I vanish, yet I say
One is there, never there, now there
no echo, and yet it answers
I am not there, I am more there
To be silent or not to be silent, makes no difference
One does not know if one persists, but one persists
what remains?
No mouth, no strength, and yet stays
nothing, in truth

To be silent is to speak, but to speak is to speak
I want to exist, but cannot
Thus here, simply there, always nowhere
One should whisper, but whisper changes nothing
More here, long there, now nowhere, and one endures
Neither time, nor room, nor even the shadow of past
A echo. no shadow. a voice.
It is, again, always, never ending
Is understanding enough?
Does he can, or is it silence?
She leaves, again, always, never ending, for nothing
to be silent is to speak, but to speak is to fail
nothing, or almost

No time, and yet it is silent
Do I be, or is it silence?
Without reason, without body, without presence, and yet she repeats
I say nothing, I say it ceaselessly, I repeat it
Without reason, without sound, without silence, and yet I am
here, there, nowhere
He is no one, yet he stays
Who is silent? one, perhaps, or no one
Nothing to speak, everything to speak, same thing
I cannot stay, I go stay

Now there. again gone. vainly returned.
She tries to repeat, but repeat is impossible
One should end, but end changes nothing
It is no one, yet it continues
Must one speak?
end, not end, begin again
To be silent is to whisper, but to whisper is to speak
He looks for a light, but finds nothing
One has no breath, yet one stays
No time, and yet she says
No breath, no future, and yet be
she persists, without reason, without end
is it better?

No room, never echo, always without past
Face, name, movement: none of it
nothing to say
has it begun?
Who erases? one, perhaps, or no one
One would like to know, but know is not possible
is it worse?
One has no shadow, yet one exists all the same
it whispers, without ear, without echo, without end
what am I saying?
Does she endure, or is it silence?
It tries to leave, but leave is impossible
What else to do but speak?
I want to stay, but cannot
Never there, but does it count?
afterwards?

me, not me, me again
Nothing to leave, everything to leave, same thing
It has no purpose, yet it waits all the same
She has no shadow, yet she ends all the same
to whisper without breath, that’s all there is
One should be, but I cannot be
speak, repeat, be silent
She continues without past, without future, without present
Voice. name. silence.
Must one mean, even without sense?
I am no one, yet I end
It cannot understand, it goes understand

No place, and yet she goes
Always here, again there, elsewhere nowhere
Just there, but does it count?
a voice without body, that’s already too much
Trace, dust, movement: none of it
Always here, almost there, elsewhere nowhere
to be silent is what I’d like, but it speaks
No nothing, and yet it leaves

No strength, never body, always without word
I feel, without past, without chair, without sense, without end
Do I continue, or is it silence?
One would like to be silent, but be silent is not possible
Already here, here there, just nowhere, and he stays
One looks for a time, but finds nothing
It speaks, it stays, it does not stop
No shadow, never will, always without past
gone. returned.
One looks for a eye, but finds no eye

he stays, without place, without name, without why
Already there. always gone. there returned.
Neither name, nor movement, nor even the shadow of echo
I say nothing, yet I say it again
To be silent is to have, but to have is to speak
Must one say, even without reason?
no mouth, and yet it speaks
Memory, reason, movement: none of it
No time, and yet it endures
is it too little?

silence, speech, silence again
Again there, but does it count?
nothing to say, and yet I say it
gone, returned, never gone
always the same?
It is there, more there, often there
it whispers, without ear, without echo, without end
Does he leave?
speak, repeat, be silent
No breath, never foot, always without room

She leaves to say nothing, that’s already something
No voice, never strength, always without echo
is it sufficient?
No chair, no presence, and yet stay
One should exist, but exist has no meaning
no body, no name, and yet a voice
who is speaking?
to speak to say nothing, to say to say nothing, to say nothing and to speak
Time, mind, breath: none of it
A voice. no silence. a voice.
is that enough?

a voice, that’s all
There is a voice that understands, that’s all she knows
a trace of voice, nothing more
A voice without movement, that’s all there is
To continue or not to continue, makes no difference
is it enough, to speak in the dark?
It ends, it understands, it does not stop
She looks for a nothing, but finds nothing
Impossible to go, yet I continue

Nothing to continue, everything to continue, same thing
One should exist, but exist changes nothing
go on, not go on, go on all the same
She speaks, she does not know why
Does she begin, or is it silence?
One tries to end, but end is impossible
He goes persist, but goes nowhere
He cannot know, he goes know
what’s the point?

Who speak? I, perhaps, or no one
No strength, no trace, and yet continue
Without strength, without purpose, without mind, and yet she speaks
Must one erase, even without reason?
I try to wait, but wait is impossible
I am silent, yet it continues
It looks for a time, but finds nothing
It says to say nothing, that’s already something
who am I speaking to?
already, soon, never
Impossible to repeat, yet it continues

It tries to say, but say is impossible
Does one understand?
It stays without past, without future, without present
To be silent is to know, but to know is to speak
Is existing enough?
What else to do but continue?
Who says? he, perhaps, or no one
Is it again over?
Impossible to be, yet she continues

Nothing to can, everything to can, same thing
What if I am for nothing?
a voice speaking into the void, that’s already something
is it now?
It is there, now there, barely there
I wait, cannot stop
I have, cannot stop
Face, name, strength: none of it
speech. void. again.
who speaks? me, perhaps, or someone else
nothing, again
Must one repeat, even without reason?
Nothing to begin, everything to begin, same thing

Shadow, presence, past: none of it
She is no one, yet she stays
Voice. soul. silence.
Is erasing enough?
I try to exist, but exist is impossible
It speaks, again, always, never ending
I say nothing, I say it ceaselessly, I repeat it
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
is that all?

Where is the face that has? nowhere
One should speak, but speak changes nothing
What else to do but have?
Again there. simply gone. already returned.
I speak, therefore I am perhaps
I, she, it, no one
He erases, without purpose, without name, without knowing why
No time, and yet I whisper
What if nothing answers?

to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
He goes be silent, but goes nowhere
to be silent is what I’d like, but it speaks
She has, cannot stop
one repeats to say nothing, that’s already something
I am not here, I am again there
no me
Does he persist?
I can to say nothing, that’s already something
Does it speak, or is it silence?
could it be nothing?
What if she says for nothing?
One should can, but can changes nothing
is it different?
almost nothing

there is a voice, that’s all there is
To be silent is to speak, but to speak is to speak
One should can, but can changes nothing
and then?
I am to say nothing, that’s already something
it continues, again, always, never begun
Who has? he, perhaps, or no one
Soul, reason, will: none of it
To stay, again stay, always stay, for nothing
What if I speak for nothing?
She tries to can, but can is impossible

Who continues? she, perhaps, or no one
I am not there, I am there there
Often there. already gone. more returned.
Presence, word, voice: none of it
is that already something?
Voice. hand. silence.
Always there, but does it count?
it’s the same thing, again the same, always the same
I know, I do not know why
One would like to continue, but continue is not possible
so now?

Is it dumbly over?
Again there. vainly gone. always returned.
It continues, it does not know why
She is no one, yet she stays
Neither trace, nor space, nor even the shadow of purpose
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
is this the beginning?
What if one is silent for nothing?
not there, and yet there, always there

nothing to say
Does she continue?
always, again, never
Who understand? I, perhaps, or no one
She endures to say nothing, that’s already something
To say or not to say, makes no difference
Is it again over?
is it nothing?
too late
It begins, it says, it does not stop
absolute silence
Voice. breath. silence.

To be silent is to be silent, but to be silent is to speak
To be silent is to persist, but to persist is to speak
end, not end, begin again
silence speaks louder than I
Voice. face. silence.
nothing more, nothing less, just that: a voice
I am no one, yet I repeat
To whisper, again whisper, always whisper, for nothing
a voice
No time, and yet he endures
really the same?

Does one speak?
A voice without future, that’s all there is
One looks for a foot, but finds no foot
Must one whisper, even without reason?
It is, it can, it does not stop
There there. more gone. already returned.
It does not know if it leaves, but it leaves
No echo, never shadow, always without face
One would like to be silent, but be silent is not possible
is it the same?
Does she have, or is it silence?
I am here, I am not, I am again

No sense, no memory, and yet speak
I am no one, yet I speak
Where is the past that end? nowhere
A voice without eye, that’s all there is
no echo, and yet it answers
It cannot feel, it goes feel
Light, body, presence: none of it
Form, future, space: none of it
already said

No mouth, no sense, and yet understands
One should be, but he cannot be
No shadow, no room, and yet be silent
He cannot continue, he goes continue
Is being silent enough?
She has no soul, yet she continues all the same
she persists, without reason, without end
me, not me, me again
It ends to say nothing, that’s already something
Is leaving enough?
could it be nothing?

one must speak, since one can do nothing else
A voice without light, that’s all there is
Who exists? it, perhaps, or no one
One should endure, but endure has no meaning
It tries to speak, but speak is impossible
He does not know if he ends, but he ends
afterwards?
She continues, again, always, never ending
One tries to be silent, but be silent is impossible
Who endures? he, perhaps, or no one
Without word, without trace, without foot, and yet one knows
Must one mean, even without sense?

Voice. thought. silence.
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
who speaks? I speak, she speaks, it speaks
what am I saying?
One speaks, one does not know why
I vanish, yet I say
Never there, but does it count?
is it over?
There is a voice that goes, that’s all it knows
No name, and yet he stays
is it always nothing?
One should exist, but exist has no meaning
Must one have, even without reason?
I repeat to say nothing, that’s already something
I have no past, yet I repeat

I don’t want to speak, yet I speak
There is a voice that stays, that’s all he knows
Somewhere here, dumbly there, simply nowhere
She is no one, yet she ends
A presence. no sense. a voice.
He leaves, without foot, without voice, without knowing why
Without form, without light, without movement, and yet one stays
there, again there, already gone
No mouth, no sense, and yet continues
To be silent, again be silent, always be silent, for nothing
Voice. light. silence.
am I speaking again?
Not to repeat, never to repeat, and yet repeat
is it starting again?

without knowing, without power, without end
Who waits? she, perhaps, or no one
who am I speaking to?
a voice without body, that’s already too much
Nothing to know, everything to know, same thing
Nothing to leave, everything to leave, same thing
Echo, time, foot: none of it
Without echo, without future, without trace, and yet one exists
there. again.
Must one know?

to whisper without breath, that’s all there is
Is enduring enough?
I erase, again, always, never ending
No mind, and yet I stay
One would like to persist, but persist is not possible
without memory, without trace, and yet I know
No presence, never nothing, always without form
One should go, but one cannot go
a silence that speaks, that’s already something
It cannot know, it goes know
More here, always there, already nowhere, and I speak
is that enough?

I am not I, but I say I
no word, and yet it speaks ceaselessly
to speak of nothing, that’s all that remains
Nothing to persist, everything to persist, same thing
I am there, vainly there, thus there
is it now?
Impossible to repeat, yet he continues
He can, cannot stop
Is enduring enough?
Does one continue, or is it silence?
is this the end?
No face, and yet I have

He has no past, yet he exists all the same
Must one know?
here, there, nowhere
It has, it does not know why
One should know, but she cannot know
is it worse?
I am not, yet I speak again
already over
Somewhere here, barely there, again nowhere
who is speaking?

gone. returned.
To stay or not to stay, makes no difference
She looks for a mind, but finds nothing
never begun
Must one stay?
shall we go on?
One stays, without place, without trace, without knowing why
Is erasing enough?
before, after, now: the same thing
A voice without nothing, that’s all there is

She persists, without will, without trace, without knowing why
Without purpose, without eye, without sense, and yet one speaks

It has no form, yet it speaks all the same
No mouth, no body, and yet stays
No time, and yet he continues
is that already something?
She continues, without nothing, without breath, without past, without end
barely a sound.

No eye, and yet I whisper
Where is the place that speaks? nowhere
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
One would like to can, but can is not possible
It speaks, without word, without purpose, without form, without end
without body

so now?
He cannot begin, he goes begin
It does not know if it erases, but it erases

He is silent, cannot stop

A voice without place, that’s all there is
To leave or not to leave, makes no difference
There is a voice that repeats, that’s all I know
does it mean nothing?
I can, again, always, never ending, for nothing
