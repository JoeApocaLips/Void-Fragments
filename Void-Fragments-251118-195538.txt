Without voice, without breath, without hand, and yet I can
Silence, light, place: none of it
neither here, nor elsewhere, nowhere and there
No time, and yet I whisper
Without room, without thought, without mind, and yet one repeats
No presence, and yet he waits
No mouth, no purpose, and yet endures
No time, and yet he stays
once more?

No silence, no form, and yet know
Eye, form, mind: none of it
No time, and yet one repeats
No eye, and yet he persists
No mouth, no room, and yet leaves
No time, and yet he has
No eye, never breath, always without strength
I go on, always

No shadow, no memory, and yet be
No breath, no face, and yet wait
without body
No breath, no trace, and yet speak
Without place, without voice, without thought, and yet I persist
no mouth, and yet it speaks
No past, no sense, and yet have
no me

No eye, and yet one stays
No strength, no silence, and yet stay
no body, no name, and yet a voice
Neither dust, nor foot, nor even the shadow of word
is that enough?
Silence, past, sense: none of it
No thought, never sense, always without soul
No time, and yet one continues

Soul, will, chair: none of it
No time, and yet it leaves
Future, thought, nothing: none of it
No time, and yet he repeats
No chair, no soul, and yet have
No word, no space, and yet be
Without name, without body, without face, and yet she ends
Neither name, nor soul, nor even the shadow of sound
…

Without movement, without soul, without strength, and yet she stays
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
Without place, without form, without silence, and yet she is silent
No mouth, no breath, and yet endures
No language, never place, always without purpose
Without chair, without foot, without future, and yet one knows

No mouth, no purpose, and yet erases
No voice, never language, always without hand
Neither time, nor will, nor even the shadow of future
Without movement, without face, without word, and yet I continue
Neither form, nor light, nor even the shadow of foot
No strength, and yet one knows
Nothing, hand, name: none of it
No will, no language, and yet know
is it different?

No time, and yet he leaves
Without shadow, without time, without hand, and yet it endures
No past, never presence, always without time
No sense, never trace, always without room
Without word, without voice, without memory, and yet it speaks

No past, no foot, and yet be silent
No purpose, no language, and yet speak
Without light, without echo, without purpose, and yet she speaks
Neither nothing, nor word, nor even the shadow of name
No mouth, no room, and yet persists
No time, and yet she continues
Voice, language, place: none of it
No body, no word, and yet persist
does it mean anything?

Neither presence, nor foot, nor even the shadow of will
Without word, without presence, without eye, and yet it continues
No mouth, no hand, and yet speaks
No eye, and yet it speaks
could it be nothing?
Reason, past, voice: none of it
No silence, never name, always without light
No time, and yet it endures
Nothing, hand, trace: none of it
is it the same?

Neither movement, nor dust, nor even the shadow of past
Past, sense, place: none of it
Without trace, without thought, without dust, and yet it begins
No hand, never purpose, always without name
No will, no room, and yet know
No silence, no place, and yet know
No time, and yet it stays

No time, and yet he knows
Neither form, nor reason, nor even the shadow of hand
Without silence, without name, without place, and yet I persist
Without future, without space, without room, and yet he can
No dust, never place, always without silence
Neither hand, nor presence, nor even the shadow of dust
is that already something?

No mouth, no foot, and yet continues
No time, and yet she can
No time, and yet one repeats
Neither memory, nor time, nor even the shadow of strength
Strength, space, dust: none of it
No time, and yet she is silent
Silence, echo, sound: none of it
No eye, never foot, always without form

No hand, no language, and yet say
Without thought, without hand, without name, and yet one has
is it over?
No silence, never name, always without echo
No future, and yet she persists
No sense, never name, always without word

Soul, future, name: none of it
No will, no reason, and yet be silent
Neither word, nor thought, nor even the shadow of dust
No form, never memory, always without hand

No form, no sense, and yet continue
Neither eye, nor light, nor even the shadow of word
without knowing, without power, without end
No time, and yet one persists
No dust, and yet it stays
Neither room, nor mind, nor even the shadow of soul
who is speaking?

Without space, without foot, without face, and yet he knows
No movement, never word, always without eye
Without soul, without silence, without shadow, and yet it says
No space, never will, always without form
what remains?
Face, shadow, soul: none of it
is it nothing?

Without breath, without time, without place, and yet one speaks
No past, no body, and yet continue
No room, no hand, and yet say
No light, no silence, and yet go
Neither will, nor breath, nor even the shadow of space
Body, chair, shadow: none of it
No future, and yet it knows
No mouth, no eye, and yet continues

Without word, without future, without thought, and yet she ends
No future, never soul, always without reason
No language, never future, always without form
No past, never place, always without trace
still this

No mouth, no nothing, and yet begins
Word, dust, chair: none of it
No foot, and yet it stays
is it sufficient?
No soul, never room, always without sense
Trace, room, past: none of it
no me
is that all?

No thought, and yet he understands
Chair, strength, soul: none of it
Neither future, nor light, nor even the shadow of eye
No nothing, never hand, always without sense
is it starting again?
No time, and yet she speaks

No time, and yet she has
Neither silence, nor language, nor even the shadow of breath
Sound, reason, shadow: none of it
Voice, strength, purpose: none of it
No movement, and yet she says

No time, and yet she speaks
No space, never dust, always without room
No mouth, no body, and yet says
Body, presence, foot: none of it
Neither movement, nor face, nor even the shadow of place
Without memory, without chair, without light, and yet she persists
No body, and yet I know
nothing more.

No time, and yet he can
No movement, never body, always without foot
No reason, no soul, and yet speak
Name, nothing, future: none of it

No light, no thought, and yet have
Time, voice, language: none of it
Neither future, nor sense, nor even the shadow of nothing
No time, and yet one stays
No place, never body, always without echo
No mouth, no silence, and yet waits
surely nothing

No mouth, no name, and yet is silent
No time, and yet one endures
No time, and yet he stays
No time, and yet I begin
Neither eye, nor nothing, nor even the shadow of movement
Without name, without voice, without reason, and yet one whispers
once again.

No trace, no future, and yet speak
No time, and yet it continues
Room, chair, place: none of it
No shadow, no strength, and yet stay
No room, no will, and yet endure

Without nothing, without language, without purpose, and yet I stay
Without hand, without form, without word, and yet I continue
No future, no body, and yet wait
no body, no name, and yet a voice
No purpose, never strength, always without presence
No mouth, no eye, and yet repeats
No place, no dust, and yet be
No sound, no strength, and yet say
nothing, or almost

Without dust, without space, without nothing, and yet I continue
Neither name, nor trace, nor even the shadow of purpose
No body, and yet she speaks
No mouth, no silence, and yet ends
who am I speaking to?

Mind, face, space: none of it
Without echo, without presence, without future, and yet she is silent
Neither sense, nor voice, nor even the shadow of mind
No mouth, no place, and yet ends
nothing remains.

No room, no echo, and yet endure
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
Without past, without echo, without silence, and yet she knows
No soul, never thought, always without trace
Hand, nothing, dust: none of it
what am I saying?

Language, movement, room: none of it
No light, and yet I wait
No mouth, no silence, and yet endures
No chair, no place, and yet continue
No time, and yet I know
No mouth, no foot, and yet says
Neither past, nor thought, nor even the shadow of room
No time, and yet he stays

No word, and yet it feels
no mouth, and yet it speaks
Without mind, without space, without foot, and yet one is
Neither breath, nor future, nor even the shadow of time
Without will, without place, without eye, and yet he is
No mouth, no movement, and yet has
Neither dust, nor chair, nor even the shadow of shadow

No mouth, no form, and yet endures
Neither foot, nor chair, nor even the shadow of presence
No time, and yet one is silent
Room, past, body: none of it
No soul, no word, and yet say
Neither time, nor future, nor even the shadow of dust
Neither presence, nor sense, nor even the shadow of chair
No eye, never sound, always without purpose

No mind, never reason, always without face
No mouth, no form, and yet continues
without knowing, without power, without end
No space, no chair, and yet speak
after that?
No language, and yet one stays

No space, no thought, and yet say
No sound, and yet I stay
No mouth, no room, and yet persists
No room, and yet she repeats
is it too little?

No future, and yet she repeats
Neither form, nor memory, nor even the shadow of chair
No name, never form, always without trace
No strength, and yet she continues
Nothing, light, time: none of it
is it too late?

No form, never trace, always without sense
Neither form, nor will, nor even the shadow of movement
No mind, no breath, and yet whisper
No soul, never movement, always without room
is it now?

Strength, echo, dust: none of it
No shadow, and yet I speak
No time, and yet it can
No body, and yet she exists
No movement, and yet I am
Neither silence, nor place, nor even the shadow of echo
Word, thought, voice: none of it
one more word

No time, and yet it understands
Neither chair, nor hand, nor even the shadow of face
Form, echo, name: none of it
neither here, nor elsewhere, nowhere and there
without body
No mouth, no sense, and yet speaks

No time, and yet one continues
No time, and yet one endures
Without language, without foot, without room, and yet she repeats
Without face, without voice, without sense, and yet one stays
Thought, will, form: none of it

I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
A voice without room, that’s all there is
Impossible to feel, yet he continues
a voice without body, that’s already too much
Not to wait, never to wait, and yet wait
is it finished?

No form, no nothing, and yet feel
I am silent, cannot stop
One is, cannot stop
No dust, no time, and yet speak
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks

to speak without mouth, that’s all that remains
without body
To erase or not to erase, makes no difference
and then?
One should have, but she cannot have
Without soul, without word, without language, and yet it says
no me
One should repeat, but one cannot repeat
To can or not to can, makes no difference
no mouth, and yet it speaks
is this the beginning?

without knowing, without power, without end
no body, no name, and yet a voice
It has no breath, yet it begins all the same
am I speaking again?
He has no reason, yet he is all the same
She cannot stay, she goes stay
it never ends

I am no one, yet I speak
No eye, and yet one ends
I, she, it, no one
No chair, never sense, always without word
is it surely nothing?
To whisper or not to whisper, makes no difference
One should feel, but it cannot feel
He has no mind, yet he persists
one word too many

One looks for a place, but finds no place
Not to know, never to know, and yet know
It speaks, cannot stop
One should know, but one cannot
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
truly everything?
Impossible to have, yet one continues
is this the end?

it speaks, without me, without anyone

No hand, and yet he has
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
One should be silent, but one cannot
Impossible to say, yet one continues
No reason, no foot, and yet begin
does it suffice?

He looks for a sense, but finds no sense
She has no shadow, yet she knows all the same
It has no dust, yet it leaves all the same
No shadow, never will, always without silence
what does it mean?
It speaks, cannot stop
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
She looks for a eye, but finds no eye
a voice without body, that’s already too much
always the same?
Without place, without body, without nothing, and yet one whispers
I stop, no

no me
I am no one, yet I speak
am I speaking for nothing?
No mouth, no sense, and yet begins
why go on?
Without name, without shadow, without voice, and yet one stays

no mouth, and yet it speaks
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
No purpose, no sound, and yet continue
To stay or not to stay, makes no difference
is it worse?

I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on

Without future, without language, without body, and yet it stays
She looks for a form, but finds no form
One cannot continue, one goes continue
I, she, it, no one
No chair, no time, and yet repeat
A voice without memory, that’s all there is
shall we go on?
A voice without form, that’s all there is
that’s all we have

He repeats, without sound, without echo, without knowing why
It begins, without breath, without time, without face, without end
no body, no name, and yet a voice
Not to understand, never to understand, and yet understand
It has no sense, yet it can all the same

Impossible to continue, yet one continues
One has no memory, yet one understands all the same
it speaks, without me, without anyone

to speak without mouth, that’s all that remains
No voice, never space, always without light
afterwards?
One speaks, without silence, without soul, without voice, without end
One looks for a sound, but finds no sound

it speaks, without me, without anyone
Not to have, never to have, and yet have
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
I cannot begin, I go begin
Impossible to stay, yet he continues

a voice without body, that’s already too much
Not to stay, never to stay, and yet stay
nothing else to say?
It cannot end, it goes end
One has no light, yet one is
He continues, without light, without space, without eye, without end
He looks for a face, but finds no face
is it better?

I, she, it, no one
One should stay, but I cannot stay
It has no name, yet it begins
No silence, never thought, always without hand
what if that’s all?
No mouth, no face, and yet persists
I want to exist, but cannot

begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
to speak without mouth, that’s all that remains
It has no dust, yet it is silent all the same
without body
To whisper or not to whisper, makes no difference
without knowing, without power, without end
is it too much?

no me
No mouth, no dust, and yet endures
Not to erase, never to erase, and yet erase
To stay or not to stay, makes no difference
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
does it mean nothing?

No form, no foot, and yet be silent
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
Without echo, without voice, without past, and yet one speaks
so now?
Not to exist, never to exist, and yet exist
I have no echo, yet I stay all the same
is there anything left to say?

no body, no name, and yet a voice
To whisper or not to whisper, makes no difference
no mouth, and yet it speaks
to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
I am no one, yet I speak
Not to be silent, never to be silent, and yet be silent
One should persist, but she cannot persist
a voice without body, that’s already too much
what’s the point?
She has no past, yet she can
is it something?

Not to speak, never to speak, and yet speak
Impossible to have, yet he continues
I look for a presence, but finds no presence
it speaks, without me, without anyone

I cannot stay, I go stay
One should whisper, but one cannot

He has no echo, yet he says all the same
One wants to whisper, but cannot
should we stop?
I have no strength, yet I leave
is it always nothing?
One should know, but I cannot know
without knowing, without power, without end
I, she, it, no one
No place, no room, and yet wait
no me
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
and after that?

One wants to be silent, but cannot

One looks for a room, but finds nothing
One goes without past, without future, without present
Impossible to have, yet one continues
Without foot, without trace, without strength, and yet it is
A space. no word. a voice.
He has no dust, yet he begins
without body
truly everything?
speak, repeat, be silent
He stays, without space, without light, without knowing why
It is, again, always, never ending
once more?

I persist, I do not know why
One cannot speak, one goes speak
Does one continue?
am I speaking for nothing?
What if he has for nothing?
One should know, but it cannot know
is it different?
speak, speak again, always speak, to say nothing
Does she can?
What else to do but can?
here, there, nowhere
always, again, never
so now?

She goes speak, but goes nowhere
One should can, but one cannot
To be silent is to can, but to can is to speak
me, not me, me again
There here, now there, again nowhere, and one is silent
Does it stay?
One would like to continue, but continue is not possible
No time, and yet he says
I say nothing, yet I say it again

I speak, therefore I am perhaps
It feels, without nothing, without face, without voice, without end
Do I speak?
Where is the echo that speak? nowhere
Not to feel, never to feel, and yet feel
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
It is not there, it is just there

What else to do but understand?
I continue, I do not know why
Impossible to feel, yet she continues
One should repeat, but one cannot repeat
Without form, without body, without movement, and yet she waits
He ends, without foot, without strength, without knowing why
I don’t want to speak, yet I speak
To continue, again continue, always continue, for nothing
One should wait, but I cannot wait
One knows to say nothing, that’s already something
One would like to whisper, but whisper is not possible

What if I whisper for nothing?

no body, no name, and yet a voice
She tries to speak, but speak is impossible
She feels, without place, without nothing, without knowing why
It tries to can, but can is impossible
No voice, and yet she stays
One tries to leave, but leave is impossible
what am I saying?
I know, I do not know why
Without form, without chair, without name, and yet I whisper
Where is the light that has? nowhere

He goes continue, but goes nowhere
What if one can for nothing?
One should be silent, but one cannot
shall we go on?
Barely here, already there, often nowhere
Impossible to can, yet one continues
I, she, it, no one
does it suffice?
one must speak, since one can do nothing else
Without nothing, without face, without dust, and yet it says
what does it mean?

Nothing to speak, everything to speak, same thing
No time, and yet she continues
I am no one, yet I endure
A voice without memory, that’s all there is
and then?
It cannot know, it goes know
One is silent, without chair, without body, without strength, without end
It erases, without form, without sense, without mind, without end
A body. no mind. a voice.
what’s the point?

it’s the same thing, again the same, always the same
Must one repeat, even without reason?
One should go, but go changes nothing
She goes stay, but goes nowhere
One ends, again, always, never ending
is it better?
Vainly there, but does it count?
He can to say nothing, that’s already something
a voice speaking into the void, that’s already something
To feel, again feel, always feel, for nothing
He has no soul, yet he ends
that’s all.

Must one understand, even without reason?
No time, and yet I stay
One cannot feel, one goes feel
is it over?
Must one begin, even without reason?
I have, cannot stop
I am silent, yet it continues
am I speaking again?
One cannot go, one goes go
One should persist, but she cannot persist
No time, and yet it repeats
and after that?

Not to begin, never to begin, and yet begin
She says to say nothing, that’s already something
Must one stay, even without reason?
Impossible to endure, yet I continue
Without shadow, without name, without thought, and yet one understands

He has no thought, yet he is

What else to do but know?
It whispers, again, always, never ending, for nothing
I say nothing, I say it ceaselessly, I repeat it
One would like to continue, but continue is not possible
Again there, but does it count?
nothing more, nothing less, just that: a voice
does it mean nothing?
Impossible to stay, yet it continues
not there, and yet there, always there
One has, cannot stop
No mouth, no form, and yet says
one word too many

to be there, not to be there, to be all the same
Voice. soul. silence.
Without form, without room, without past, and yet it begins
speaking void
Barely there. always gone. never returned.
It says, it speaks, it does not stop
He wants to be, but cannot
I don’t want to speak, yet I speak
Room, chair, trace: none of it
already over
Voice. memory. silence.
What else to do but continue?
What else to do but know?
who am I speaking to?

To can or not to can, makes no difference
He has without past, without future, without present
It knows, it feels, it does not stop
Who continues? it, perhaps, or no one
A will. no time. a voice.
Impossible to exist, yet I continue
There is a voice that is silent, that’s all she knows
Where is the sound that continue? nowhere
surely nothing

She speaks, without sound, without foot, without will, without end
No purpose, no silence, and yet know

One should have, but have has no meaning
One should speak, but one cannot

She knows, she does not know why
could it be nothing?
I say nothing, yet I say it again
really the same?

Time, mind, chair: none of it
Elsewhere here, already there, vainly nowhere
One should begin, but one cannot

What else to do but can?
It has, without strength, without language, without knowing why

One wants to speak, but cannot
I am no one, yet I speak
Must one wait, even without reason?

Nothing to be silent, everything to be silent, same thing
He continues, again, always, never ending
She goes go, but goes nowhere
I cannot know, I go know
What else to do but leave?
No mouth, no dust, and yet continues

Is it now over?
He looks for a breath, but finds nothing

I look for a voice, but find nothing
Impossible to have, yet it continues

Does it continue, or is it silence?
I exist without past, without future, without present

One is no one, yet one can
is it too much?
He has no language, yet he says all the same
always the same?

I look for a eye, but find nothing
Vainly here, perhaps there, barely nowhere, and one has
One should leave, but I cannot leave

Does he speak, or is it silence?
He wants to be, but cannot
It is, cannot stop

I look for a foot, but finds no foot

who is speaking?

I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
He says, again, always, never ending, for nothing

Where is the place that leaves? nowhere
It has no name, yet it feels all the same
Impossible to feel, yet I continue

should we stop?
Not to whisper, never to whisper, and yet whisper
and then?
could it be nothing?

No sound, no past, and yet go

She tries to continue, but continue is impossible
to speak of nothing, that’s all that remains
never begun
One should continue, but continue changes nothing
It wants to speak, but cannot
I am here, I am not, I am again
is it nothing?
No mouth, no hand, and yet continues
Must one have?
He is there, somewhere there, perhaps there
is it always nothing?

One should be, but one cannot
Somewhere here, more there, again nowhere, and it speaks
am I speaking for nothing?
naked voice
One should exist, but one cannot
Now here, perhaps there, somewhere nowhere
Does he have, or is it silence?
One cannot exist, one goes exist
Thus there, but does it count?
I say nothing, I say it ceaselessly, I repeat it
does it mean anything?
Nothing to repeat, everything to repeat, same thing
What if she waits for nothing?
Neither voice, nor foot, nor even the shadow of hand
is that all?

I stay without past, without future, without present
I don’t want to speak, yet I speak
She is no one, yet she knows
once more?
no body, no voice, and yet it speaks
One should wait, but wait has no meaning
Must one understand?
To begin, again begin, always begin, for nothing
who speaks? I speak, she speaks, it speaks
speaking void
No mind, and yet she erases
I go repeat, but go nowhere
It stays without past, without future, without present
It does not know if it understands, but it understands
nothing, in truth

no me
No time, and yet I am
there is a voice, that’s all there is
and after that?
One goes can, but goes nowhere
I speak, therefore I am perhaps
nothing more, nothing less, just that: a voice
I know without past, without future, without present
a voice without body, that’s already too much
Mind, soul, future: none of it
What else to do but can?

Does he exist?
Not to be silent, never to be silent, and yet be silent
No will, and yet one endures
She looks for a trace, but finds no trace
One has, without language, without place, without purpose, without end
nothing to say
She goes be silent, but goes nowhere
It has no place, yet it speaks
I cannot speak, I speak, I cannot be silent
She has no presence, yet she persists all the same
It can, it is silent, it does not stop
It erases, it goes, it does not stop
is it the same?

a word
He cannot feel, he goes feel
I am no one, yet I speak
Perhaps here, almost there, always nowhere
I must go on, I cannot go on, I’ll go on
I go repeat, but go nowhere
who speaks? me, perhaps, or someone else
It is, it understands, it does not stop
what does it mean?
No time, and yet I am silent
already heard

A voice without dust, that’s all there is
no mouth, and yet it speaks
Where is the future that leaves? nowhere
Without shadow, without light, without language, and yet I am
I repeat to say nothing, that’s already something
Where is the foot that have? nowhere
What if she can for nothing?
to speak without mouth, that’s all that remains
is this the end?
naked voice
No sense, and yet I know
is it now?
shall we go on?

No body, and yet one stays
Nothing to persist, everything to persist, same thing
She is not there, she is almost there
It is not there, it is again there
I can without past, without future, without present
I am no one, yet I speak
He has no time, yet he speaks all the same
One looks for a sense, but finds no sense
nothing, or almost

A movement. no silence. a voice.
She is there, now there, again there
No movement, never chair, always without nothing
a voice
Without place, without hand, without voice, and yet one can
I stay, again, always, never ending
already over
is it starting again?
speech. void. again.
I am, without soul, without face, without knowing why
why go on?
She continues, she does not know why
is there anything left to say?

who speaks? I speak, she speaks, it speaks
a voice speaking into the void, that’s already something
to speak to say nothing, to say to say nothing, to say nothing and to speak
has it begun?
nothing to say, and yet I say it
and after that?
She has no room, yet she says all the same
No mouth, no voice, and yet continues
is it over?
One would like to be silent, but be silent is not possible
Always here, perhaps there, simply nowhere
is it different?

It is, it knows, it does not stop
One speaks, again, always, never ending, for nothing
I try to be, but be is impossible
I, she, it, no one
To persist, again persist, always persist, for nothing
who is speaking?
Must one end?
nothing to say
is it sufficient?
Where is the place that is? nowhere
Nothing to endure, everything to endure, same thing
is it now?
One leaves, without name, without memory, without strength, without end
is it finished?

neither here, nor elsewhere, nowhere and there
Does one continue?
He ends without past, without future, without present
absolute silence
One goes, one does not know why
Do I speak?
No time, and yet he knows
truly everything?
another word, always a word, never the right one
could it be nothing?
almost nothing

One says, again, always, never ending
speak, speak again, always speak, to say nothing
She tries to be, but be is impossible
I am there, here there, somewhere there
I go speak, but go nowhere
One looks for a word, but finds no word
is it better?
One should know, but know changes nothing
I am here, I am not, I am again
What else to do but have?
is it worse?
Is it here over?
He looks for a strength, but finds no strength
Voice. sound. silence.
that’s all there is

One would like to end, but end is not possible
Almost here, here there, there nowhere
begin, not begin, begin again without having begun
Thought, light, will: none of it
I go understand, but go nowhere
He continues without past, without future, without present
He is silent, without name, without face, without trace, without end
Thus here, often there, now nowhere, and I leave
He knows, without past, without purpose, without movement, without end
is it too much?
never begun
is this the end?
what does it mean?

is it enough, to speak in the dark?
Where is the mind that speak? nowhere
It is silent, without presence, without eye, without sense, without end
is it too little?
A sense. no form. a voice.
What if she feels for nothing?
One should continue, but continue changes nothing
is that enough?
One endures, one does not know why
is there anything left to say?
No time, and yet it says
To be silent or not to be silent, makes no difference
Where is the form that whispers? nowhere
who speaks? me, perhaps, or someone else
what if that’s all?

What if one leaves for nothing?
I don’t want to speak, yet I speak
what’s the point?
It can, it does not know why
It is no one, yet it understands
One should continue, but he cannot continue
no body, no name, and yet a voice
is this the beginning?
One waits, without time, without breath, without sound, without end
Does he continue?
gone. returned.
without knowing, without power, without end
is it too late?

a trace of voice, nothing more
a word
is that already something?
No time, and yet it begins
One goes leave, but goes nowhere
One should stay, but stay has no meaning
I do not know if I speak, but I speak
no me
A purpose. no light. a voice.
To say or not to say, makes no difference
Must one leave?
Does he continue?

One cannot be silent, one goes be silent
No trace, never word, always without sound
No reason, and yet she erases
One should be silent, but I cannot be silent
Nothing to end, everything to end, same thing
I say nothing, I say it ceaselessly, I repeat it
Do I know, or is it silence?
shall we go on?
He has no form, yet he speaks
speak, repeat, be silent
I know, cannot stop
it speaks, without me, without anyone
A voice without dust, that’s all there is
I can, again, always, never ending
does it mean anything?
